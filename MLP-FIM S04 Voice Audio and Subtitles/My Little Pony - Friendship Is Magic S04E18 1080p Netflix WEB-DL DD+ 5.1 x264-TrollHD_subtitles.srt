very difficult to show Maud

165
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,458
what a strong fashion presence

166
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,458

167
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,166

nervous about Maud's visit.

173
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:25,250
She's Pinkie Pie's sister

174
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,291
and it's obvious Pinkie really

175
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:28,291
wants us to hit it off.

176
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:30,667
Being able to make those rock

178
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,500

00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,542
<i>(sniff)</i>

194
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:22,542
Hmm.

195
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,083
(very laid back)

196
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,083
Sedimentary.

197
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,500
Huh?

198
00:05:26,542 --> 00:05:28,125
This is a sedimentary rock.

199
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:34,333
That's really fascinating,

200
00:05:30,709 --> 00:05:34,333
isn't it, girls?

201
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,542
We're just so thrilled you

202
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:36,542
could come for a visit

203
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,000
before your big trip.

204
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,583
Pinkie Pie has told

205
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,583
us so much about you.

206
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,750
I'm Twilight and this is

207
00:05:40,625 --> 00:05:43,750
Applejack, Fluttershy,

208
00:05:43,792 --> 00:05:46,125
Rainbow Dash, and Rarity.

209
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,875
We're ever so

210
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:47,875
glad to meet you.

211
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,458
We're just gonna

212
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,458
have the best time.

213
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,834
Pinkie Pie tells me you

214
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,834
share my love for fashion.

215
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,291
I'm really into expressing

216
00:05:56,875 --> 00:06:00,291
myself through my wardrobe.

217
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,917
And what is the delightful

218
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,917
frock you're wearing now saying?

219
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:06,792
It doesn't talk.

220
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:08,500
It's a dress.

221
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,083
Oh! Yes. Of course.

222
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,083
I just meant...

223

00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,083
<i>(dog barks)</i>

225
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,458
Uh. So this here's Winona.

226
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,792
<i>That's Owlowiscious...</i>

227
00:06:19,834 --> 00:06:22,417
Tank, Opal, and Angel.

228
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,625
Pinkie Pie told us

229
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,625
you have a pet, too.

230
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,500
He's in my pocket.

231
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,542
Oooh, You have a pocket pet?

232
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,834
Like a tiny mouse?

233
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:32,208
Or a baby bird?

234
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,625
Or a trained butterfly?

235
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,041
It's a rock.

236
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,125
His name is Boulder.

237
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,792
This is going to be the best,

238
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,792
most awesome, funnest week ever.

239
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:51,166
I can't wait for us all

240
00:06:47,834 --> 00:06:51,166
to become bestest friends.

241
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,291
<i>(nervous chuckles)</i>

242
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,291
Maud? Would ya care to

243
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,291
try one of Granny Smith's

244
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,500
famous apple spice muffins?

245
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:08,750
<i>(sniffing)</i>

246
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:10,625
Oh, uh, ha, that's not--

247
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:15,959
<i>(munching)</i>

248
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,333
It's crunchy.

249
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,834
Maud's right. They

250
00:07:19,709 --> 00:07:21,834
are crunchy!

251
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:22,834
<i>(slurp)</i>

252
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,000
Yum.

253
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,917
So, uh, Pinkie Pie

254
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:27,917
tells us you like games.

255
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:33,083
Boulder and I sometimes play a

256
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:33,083
game called "camouflage."

257
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,750
It's kind of like

258
00:07:33,125 --> 00:07:34,750
"hide-and-seek,"

259
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:36,917
but way more intense.

260
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,542
Awesome.

261
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,333
Any luck?

262
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,500
I truly wish I had spent

263
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,500
more time with Boulder,

264
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,583
because I'm having a very

265
00:07:48,542 --> 00:07:50,583
hard time remembering

266
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,458
what he looks like.

267
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,000
It's like lookin' for

268
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,000
a pebble in a haystack.

269
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,041
More like, "in a pile

270
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:57,041
of pebbles."

271
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,458
Well, you don't have to

272
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,458
make it even harder.

273
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,250
Agh! I give

274
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,250
up.

275
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,583
This is impossible.

276
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,208
It'll hurt Maud's feelings

277
00:08:03,625 --> 00:08:06,208
if we all stop playing.

278
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,458
Besides, look how much

279
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,458
fun Pinkie Pie is having.

280
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,000
IS THIS IT? IS THIS IT?

281
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,000
IS THIS IT? IS THIS IT?

282
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,834
Just a little longer, OK?

283
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:17,792
(groan) All right. Fine.

284
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,834
<i>Maud: Found him.</i>

285
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,291
Where was he?

286
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,667
He was hiding in my pocket.

287
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,041
Oh, come on!

288
00:08:29,917 --> 00:08:33,041
<i>(squeaking)</i>

289
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:34,458
I don't mean to interrupt,

290
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,458
but we really should get these

291
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,458
little critters home.

292
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,333
It's getting awfully late and

293
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,333
they've had a very busy day.

294
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,875
Maud and I'd better

295
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:40,875
get going, too.

296
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,667
I want her to taste

297
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,667
the rock candy

298
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,000
we're going to use for our...

299
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:46,417
...best friends necklaces.

300
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,458
Oh yeah!

301
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,458
She sure is different

302
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,458
from what I expected.

303
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,375
We spent all day

304
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,375
digging in the dirt

305
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:00,375
and he was in her pocket

306
00:08:57,417 --> 00:09:00,375
the whole time?

307
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:03,291
On the bright side, Boulder

308
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:03,291
seemed really sweet.

309
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,458
He's a ROCK!

310
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,875
Come on, girls.

311
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:09,291
I'm sure Maud was just nervous

312
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:09,291
about meeting all of us.

313
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,417
Maybe she was just

314
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:11,417
acting a little "off"

315
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,083
because she's shy or somethin'.

316
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,583
Exactly.

317
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,417
It must be awfully intimidating

318
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,417
to meet all of us at once,

319
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,875
especially since we're

320
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,875
already such good friends.

321
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,834
<i>(agreeement)</i>

322
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,834
Maybe if we spent some

323
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:25,834
time with her one-on-one

324
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,583
to try to get to

325
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,583
know her better?

326
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,125
I'm sure we'll be making those

327
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,125
best-friend rock candy necklaces

328
00:09:30,166 --> 00:09:31,375
in no time.

329
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,709
<i>Rarity: Where shall we start?</i>

330
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,166
I've chosen a few fabrics

331
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,166
I think would be stunning with--

332
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,166
Choices, choices, choices.

333
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,041
Of course, if you don't see

334
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,041
anything that speaks to you,

335
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,458
I would be happy to suggest--

336
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:48,000
I like this one.

337
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,208
<i>(giggling)</i>

338
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,709
Pinkie Pie didn't tell

339
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:52,709
us you were so funny.

340
00:09:54,792 --> 00:09:56,625
What do you mean?

341
00:09:56,667 --> 00:10:00,208
Oh, well, it's just, I

342
00:09:56,667 --> 00:10:00,208
believe that is a dish towel.

343
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:07,083
But, it does go very

344
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:07,083
well with your complexion.

345
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,041
I'm sure I could

346
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,041
work my magic

347
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,458
and turn it into

348
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:11,458
something fabulous.

349
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,583
Rarity and my sister

350
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,583
working together

351
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,500
to design something amazing.

352
00:10:15,542 --> 00:10:18,583
This is the best day ever!

353
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,333
Perhaps I could sew

354
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,333
all of these together

355
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,000
and make you something

356
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,000
you would like.

357
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,000
No, thanks.

358
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:24,083
One is enough.

361
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,417

become my friends.

576
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,959
But I just don't think

577
00:17:49,959 --> 00:17:51,959
it's going to happen.

578
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,250
I think it would be best if I

579
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,250
just go back to the Rock Farm

580
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,083
and spend the rest of

581
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:57,083
the week there.

582
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,709
It was nice to meet you all.

583
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,542
Makes me happy knowing Pinkie

584
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:03,542
Pie has such good friends.

585
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,917
But we never even got to make

586
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:09,917
our rock candy necklaces.

587
00:18:09,959 --> 00:18:13,750
Wait, Maud. I'll come with you.

588
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,500
I can't believe Maud

589
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,500
cut her trip short.

590
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,625
I can't believe we

591
00:18:16,542 --> 00:18:18,625
nearly lost Pinkie Pie

592
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,125
to that ridiculous

593
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:21,125
obstacle course.

594
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,166
Thank goodness Maud was

595
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,166
able to reach her in time.

596
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,750
Did you see how

597
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,750
fast Maud moved?

598
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:30,000
And the way she smashed

599
00:18:26,792 --> 00:18:30,000
that huge rock into dust?

606
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,166
That's it! I think

607
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,166
I've finally realized

608
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,375
what we all have in

609
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,375
common with Maud.

610
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,583
Something that just might be

611
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:45,583
worthy of a very important,

612
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,083
super-duper special tradition

613
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,291
that only the closest and
