scoring system,

79
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,417
which I will elaborate

80
00:02:21,333 --> 00:02:24,417
upon now. Firstly...

81
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,750
Aw, Get to the

82
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:26,750
nitty gritty later.

83
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:30,291
Tell them the important

84
00:02:26,792 --> 00:02:30,291
stuff: like who's the coach?

And you know why I'm

88
00:02:33,792 --> 00:02:36,875
qualified to coach you?

89
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:39,291
Guess who carried the

90
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:39,291
Cloudsdale flag in the Games

91
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,083

93
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,375

94
00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:46,166

95
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,000
spreading my wings,

96
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:50,000

<i>and no pony's seen since!</i>

101

Professionalism, Ms. Dash,

102
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:02,875
I must insist.

103
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,709
If you want to keep your job

104
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,709
as coach of these ponies,

105
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,542
you must maintain a

106
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,542
professional attitude

107
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:10,709

emotions in check!

109
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,041
Am I making myself absolutely,

110
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,041

111
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,125

I bet everypony in class

163

164
00:04:46,542 --> 00:04:50,583

166
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:52,125
So it might as well be us!

167
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,583
Crusaders, are you in,

168
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,583

Me three!

172
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,083
All right, the winning

173
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,083
routine needs to show

174
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,125
what's important about

175
00:05:01,125 --> 00:05:03,125
Ponyville, right?

176
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,375
Both: Right!

177
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,166
So what's special

178
00:05:04,417 --> 00:05:07,166
about Ponyville?

179
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:09,083
It's...It's...

180
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:13,834
I've got it!

181
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,417
It's a place where

182
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,417
different kinds of ponies

183
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,375
live together as friends.

184
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:19,166
Earth Ponies, like me!

185
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:21,000
Unicorns, like me!

186
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,917
And Pegasi, like me!

187
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,125
So somehow we gotta figure out

188
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,125
a way to show that in our act.

189
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,583
We're gonna

190
00:05:26,166 --> 00:05:27,583
need a plan.

191
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,417
And a lotta

192
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:29,417
hard work.

193
00:05:29,458 --> 00:05:31,458
And a whole bunch

194

00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,083
You should have been

383
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,083
flying long ago!

384
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,834
So what if my wings

385
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,834
can't get me off the ground?

386
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,375
Your career as a

387
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,375
flag carrier

388
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,000
isn't getting off

389
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:41,000
the ground, either.

390
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,375
Ms. Harshwhinny will

391
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,375
never pick a Pegasus pony

392

00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:48,291

396
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,208
Ms. Harshwinny never

397
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,208

399
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,333

Even if your routine

403
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,875
will never...how shall I say?

404
00:11:58,917 --> 00:12:01,166
"Take off."

405
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,250
Don't listen to them, Scootaloo.

406
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,458
Scootaloo?

407
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,583
You OK?

408
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,834
This routine isn't

409
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,834
working how it is.

410
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,000
We've gotta rethink

411
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:11,000
my part in the whole thing.

412
00:12:11,041 --> 00:12:12,000
WHAT?

413
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:13,166
Why?

414
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,709
If we want to win, I'm

415
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,709
gonna have to fly.

416
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,917
Is that even possible?

417
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,542
And by tomorrow?

418
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,709
Maybe I can fly if I

419
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,709
work twice as hard.

420
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,000
See?

421
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,208
Oof!

422
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,458

I don't think

426
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,291
that's the problem.

427
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,792
Well, I know

428
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,792
this for sure:

429
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,625
flying is the only

430
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:32,625
way we're gonna win.

431
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:34,875
So it's back to practice!

432
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:36,500
Is this a good idea?

433
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:39,333
<i>Whooah! (thud)</i>

434
00:12:39,375 --> 00:12:41,291

436
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,834
Probably not.

437

438
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:49,583
