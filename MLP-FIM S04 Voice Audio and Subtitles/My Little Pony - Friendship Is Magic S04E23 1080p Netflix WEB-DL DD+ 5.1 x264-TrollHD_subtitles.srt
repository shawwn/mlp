579
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,375
Awful?

580
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:06,667
What happened?

581
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:09,333
Rarity, you're OK?

582
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,834
I...I think so.

583
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,709
Though by the looks of it,

584
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,709
something quite terrifying

585
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,542
has happened to Ponyville.

586
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:20,291
<i>You happened.</i>

587
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:21,375
Me?

588
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,375
The last part of the spell!

589
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,667
"Only when true

590
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:27,667
words are spoken,

591
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:30,375
will you finally be set free."

592
00:20:31,458 --> 00:20:33,250
The spell took over you

593
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,667
and you wanted to change

594
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,667
everything in Equestria.

595
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:38,750
I was afraid to tell you

596
00:20:35,709 --> 00:20:38,750
how I really felt about it,

597
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:42,166
but then I, I told

598
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:42,166
you the truth.

599
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:46,291
Dearest Spike, you should never

600
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:46,291
be afraid to tell me the truth.

601
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,917
We're friends, remember?

602
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,542
<i>Spike: Today I learned</i>

603
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,542
<i>how important it is</i>

604
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,083
<i>to be honest with your friends</i>

605
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,291
<i>when they're doing something</i>

606
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:58,041
<i>that you don't think is right.</i>

607
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,333
A true friend knows

608
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,333
that you're speaking up

609
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,667
because you care about them.

610
00:21:01,709 --> 00:21:02,667
<i>(door opens)</i>

611
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,083
Spike!

612
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:08,291
Never, ever, ever take another

613
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:08,291
book out of the library

614
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,667
at the Castle without asking.

615
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,291
Princess Cadance

616
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:12,291
and Princess Luna

617
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,125
have much better things to do

618
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:15,125
than help me clean up Ponyville.

619
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,041
Do you have any idea how

620
00:21:17,667 --> 00:21:20,041
hard it was to reverse

621
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,166
that much dark magic?

622
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,333
You don't look so good.

623
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,959
What?

624
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,166
I'm just being honest.

625
00:21:28,208 --> 00:21:29,625
It's what good friends do.

626
