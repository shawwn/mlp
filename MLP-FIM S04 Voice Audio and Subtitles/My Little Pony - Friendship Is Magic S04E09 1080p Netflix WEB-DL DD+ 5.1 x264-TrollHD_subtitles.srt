00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,667
Say, "Best siblings ever!"

384
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,125
That's another keeper!

385
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,834
<i>Granny: It's OK, y'all!</i>

386
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,750
I traveled down this

387
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,750
river as a filly

388
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:16,000
and I know it like

389
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:16,000
the back of my hoof!

390
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,166
Are you sure you

391
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,166
know which way to go?

392
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,458
Does a june bug like

393
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,458
to hide in a tree?

394
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,166
I don't know.

395
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, I do know.

396
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,250

<i>wanna head Southeast.</i>

398
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,667
Now step aside, young 'un.

399
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,875
Um, Granny?

400
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,041
Uh huh?

401
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,250
<i>Are we supposed to</i>

402
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:38,250
<i>go through a cave?</i>

403
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't worry, child.

404
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,792
The scariest cave in Equestria

405
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:42,792
was down that other way.

406
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,792
The scariest cave

407
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,792

00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,208
Oh, it's a fright

409
00:11:46,834 --> 00:11:48,208
all right.

410
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,250
Filled with creatures that'll

411
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,250
eat ya soon as look at ya.

412
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,750
Oooh! Sounds scary.

413
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,000
Tell us more.

414
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,709
<i>Granny: Ponies go in.</i>

415
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,792
<i>But they never come out.</i>

416
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,709
And you're sure

417
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,709
it's not that cave?

418
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,500
