00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:13,375
Two more minutes, Twilight?

4
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:15,333
I'm just getting to

5
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:15,333
the really good part.

6
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:16,500
The Mane-iac is about to--

7
00:00:16,542 --> 00:00:18,000
The Mane-iac?

8
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,709
The Power Ponies'

9
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,709
most evil nemesis.

10
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,709
She was the power-mad owner

11
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:23,709
of a hair-care product company.

12
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,625
A tragic accident at her shampoo

13
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,625
factory in Maretropolis

14
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,000
not only gave her mane

15
00:00:26,667 --> 00:00:29,000
strange new powers,

16
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:31,417
but also caused her to go...

17
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:34,750
...completely insane!

18
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:37,417
She and her henchponies

19
00:00:34,792 --> 00:00:37,417
are planning to break into

20
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,709
the Maretropolis Museum

21
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:40,709
and steal the Electro-Orb

22
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,458
so she can use it to power

23
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:43,458
up her doomsday device.

24
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,542
Of course, the Mane-iac

25
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,542
wouldn't have even known

26
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,542
if Hum Drum hadn't slipped

27
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:49,542
up and told her all about it.

28
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:51,083
Hum Drum?

29
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,917
Guy in the blue boots

30
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:53,917
and pointless red cape.

31
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:57,583
The Power Ponies' bumbling

32
00:00:53,959 --> 00:00:57,583
and totally useless side-kick.

33
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,333
The Power Ponies have

34
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,333
to stop the Mane-iac

35
00:00:59,375 --> 00:01:03,208
or Mare-tropolis is doomed!

36
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,834
Believe me, Spike, if anypony

37
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,834

38
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,500
