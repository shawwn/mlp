enough to trade.

127
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,875

128
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:28,291

131
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,959
That way, if one of us finds

132
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,959
something real valuable

133
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,166
she can't live without...

134
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,959
She'll definitely

135
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:36,959
be able to get it.

136
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,250
Who could say no to

Oh, yes, that is

146
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,458

149
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,500
I may be the princess on duty,

150
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:03,500

151
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:06,083
I have to sit up there

152
00:04:03,542 --> 00:04:06,083
all alone doing nothing.

153
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,917
Ever since I became a princess,

154
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,917
Celestia has been sending me

155
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,583

157
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,583

158
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:13,583
while we're here.

159
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,417
I might as well trade away some

160
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:16,417
books I don't need any more.

161
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:17,917
Mm hm!

162
00:04:20,417 --> 00:04:22,625
(gasp) There it is!

163
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,792

165
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:27,542
It hasn't been traded yet!

166
00:04:27,583 --> 00:04:29,291
Lucky for you.

167
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:31,792

169
00:04:31,834 --> 00:04:33,500

176
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,333

anything to me.

178
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:49,375

194
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,834
<i>I'll trade you</i>

195
00:05:12,083 --> 00:05:13,834
<i>the book for it.</i>

196
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:16,834
You got it!

197
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,208
I don't know how, but somehow

198
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,208
we're gonna get that Orthros.

199
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:29,542
Oh, Applejack!

200
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:31,166
I am so glad I found you.

201
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,667
Me, too. You're not

202
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,667
gonna believe it.

203
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:34,166
<i>(both at once)</i>

204
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,333
I found a super valuable vintage

205
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,333
item I just have to have.

206
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,667
And all it's going to

207
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,667
cost is all our stuff!

208
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,083
Uh-oh.

209
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,125
So where is this

210
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,125
valuable vintage item

211
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,834
you want to trade

212
00:05:46,166 --> 00:05:48,834
everything we have for?

213
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,125
There.

214
00:05:51,834 --> 00:05:52,792
Where?

215
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:53,834
Right there.

216
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,917
<i>But that's a dented</i>

217
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:57,917
<i>old pie tin.</i>

218
00:05:57,959 --> 00:06:00,291
A dented vintage pie tin.

219
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,917
The metal they used to fashion

220
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,917
this one helps cook the pies

221
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,917
up to five seconds faster.

222
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,333
<i>They don't make 'em</i>

223
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:07,333
<i>like this anymore.</i>

224
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,208
I am so glad you showed

225
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:10,208
that to me, darling.

226
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,458
<i>(crash)</i>

227
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,250
Because once you

228
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,250
see what I found,

229
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,083
<i>you won't want to waste</i>

230
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:16,083
<i>our trade goods on that.</i>

231
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:20,000
<i>Just look at this</i>

232
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:20,000
<i>gorgeous vintage brooch.</i>

233
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:21,375
It's one of a kind.

234
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,792
It looks exactly like the

235
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,792
one you're already wearing.

236
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,709
Well, yes, they

237
00:06:26,834 --> 00:06:28,709
may look the same.

238
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,000
But I know it's older.

239
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,208
That's what makes it

240
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,208
so much more divine.

241
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,458
But that doesn't

242
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,458
make a lick of sense.

243
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,333
Why I wager if I

244
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,333
switched 'em up,

245
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,250
you wouldn't even

246
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:38,250
know the difference.

247
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,166
Oh, don't be silly;

248
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:40,166
of course I would.

249
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,333
So which is the vintage one?

250
00:06:51,834 --> 00:06:53,208
That one, of course.

251
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,000
Ha! You're bluffin'.

252
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,125
Am I?

253
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,625
How can you tell?

254
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,333
Well, because...

255
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,125
Agh! I can't.

256
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,542
'Cause the one you want to

257
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:04,542
waste our whole stash on

258
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,834
is exactly the same as

259
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,834
the one you already got.

260
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,083
There's no way anypony

261
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:09,083
would notice the difference.

262
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,709
I'd say it's a lot more

263
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,709
likely they'd notice that

264
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,709
than some dented tin

265
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,709
that cooked a pie

266
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,083
a whole two

267
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:17,083
seconds faster.

268
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,125
It's five

269
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:19,125
seconds faster!

270
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:24,959

<i>(threatening barks)</i>

273
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,083
Yes, such a good

two-headed boy.

275
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,458
Yes you are.

276
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,417
Stop that!

277
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,333
Come on! Don't you

278
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,333
start now, too.

279
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:54,208
OK, I can see you're busy, so

280
00:07:50,917 --> 00:07:54,208
I'll give it to you straight.

281
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,250
I need to trade this

282
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,250
horse shoe for ...that.

283
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,750
Nope.

284
00:07:59,792 --> 00:08:01,500
<i>(groan)</i>

285
00:08:01,542 --> 00:08:02,500
<i>Down boy!</i>

286
00:08:02,542 --> 00:08:03,709
Watch out for the lamp.

287
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,750
<i>(smash)</i>

288
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,333
Well, I could use

289
00:08:06,792 --> 00:08:09,333
another lamp.

290
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,250
<i>A whole stand filled with</i>

291
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,250
<i>Discord-shaped lamps?</i>

292
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:17,291
Seriously?

293
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,291
They really do have everything

294
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,291
at the Traders Exchange.

295
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,542
Will you trade a lamp

296
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,542
for my horse shoe,

297
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,208
so I can trade it for an

298
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:25,208
Orthros and get my book?

299
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,417
No.

300
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,583
But I'd trade it for

301
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,583
an antique chicken.

302
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,709
Great!

303
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,542
What's an antique chicken?

304
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:38,125
Oh, I got all kinds of

305
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:38,125
antique chicken statues:

306
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,041
I got your Blue Hens,

307
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:41,041
Speckled Greys, your...

308
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,166
OK, cool.

309
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,000
So will you trade

310
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,000
one for a horse shoe,

311
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,000
<i>so I can trade it for a lamp and</i>

312
00:08:44,041 --> 00:08:47,000
<i>then trade it for an Orthros</i>

313
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,458
<i>so I can get my book?</i>

314
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,792
Well, let me think.

315
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:52,750
Uh, no.

316
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,333
<i>(sighs)</i>

317
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,250
But I'd gladly trade one of my

318
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:57,250
chickens for a crystal chalice.

319
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,709
<i>(panting)</i>

320
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,792
Hang on a sec.

00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:03,208
<i>(big inhale)</i>

322
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,125
<i>We need a crystal chalice</i>

323
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,125

<i>trade for an Orthros.</i>

326
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,417
So what are you

327
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,417
willing to trade for?

328
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,625
I'm guessing it's gotta

329
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,625
be some crazy thing

330
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:13,625
way across the Exchange.

331
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,959
Actually, I could use a

332
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,959
slightly rusty old horse shoe.

333
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,250
Yeah, but where am

334
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,250
I gonna find...wait!

335
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,417
I've got one of those!

336
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:26,041
Now that we've got the chalice,

337
00:09:23,417 --> 00:09:26,041
this is gonna be a cinch.

338
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,542
Do you really think so?

339
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,792
All we gotta do is bring this

340
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,792
thing to the chicken stand

341
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:30,792
and we are--

342
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,208
<i>(smash)</i>

343
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,458
<i>(horrified scream)</i>

344
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,291
You want me to trade all

345
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,291
my books for a broken pen?

346
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,959
All right fine, you got

347
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,959
yourself a dea--

348
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,834
Stop! What are you doing?

349
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,000
I was trying to get rid of all

350
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:49,000
the books I don't need anymore.

351
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,208
For that?

352
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:53,583
Do you really want that?

353
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:55,667
Well, not really.

354
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,875
But I'm running out of

355
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:57,875
library space, so-

356
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,709
Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!

357
00:09:57,917 --> 00:09:59,709
Oh my gosh!

358
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,917
I can't believe that

359
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,917
almost happened.

360
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,500
But luckily it didn't happen.

361
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:03,583
Thanks to me.

362
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,291
What are you talking about?

363
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,917
According to the

364
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,917
rules of the Exchange,

365
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,041
a trade is only fair

366
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,041
if both ponies end up

367
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,291
with something they want.

368
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,959
You can't break

369
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,959
the rules.

370
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,417
Did anypony see you do it?

371
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:16,125
I don't think anypony saw.

372
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,875
But you're not going to

373
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,875
say anything, are you?

374
00:10:19,917 --> 00:10:20,875
Just kidding.

375
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:21,875
Or am I?

376
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,083
Sometimes I can't

377
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:23,083
even tell...

378
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,250
You know, if you

379
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,250
want to go check out

380
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,667
the rest of the Exchange and

381
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:29,667
trade whatever you brought...

382
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:32,041
Nope. I just came

383
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:32,041

577
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,709
It's crazy. I don't

578
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,709
want one in my house.

579
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,250
<i>(snarl)</i>

580
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,166
There, there; that's

581
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,166
a good Orthros.

582
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,125
You just have to know

583
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,125
how to treat them.

584
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,792
With a little patient training

585
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,792
and a big slobber mop,

586
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:13,083
they can be a wonderful

587
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:13,083
household pet.

588
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,709

589
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,041
<i>(laughing)</i>

590
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:19,583
All right, all right.

591
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:20,625
I'll trade you.

592
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:23,792
Yes!

593
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,000
<i>If she comes and stays</i>

00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,000

<i>until it's trained.</i>

596
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:35,083
Gosh. Training an Orthros

597
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:35,083
takes a long time.

598
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,750
I'll probably be gone

599
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,750
from Ponyville for...

600
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,583
I don't even know

601
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:39,583
how many moons.

602
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,875
But if that is what

603
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,875
you really want.

604
00:17:45,917 --> 00:17:47,333
So we got a fair deal?

605
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,834
Of course, it's a deal!

606
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,834
Yeah ha ha!

607
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:52,834
<i>(whoosh)</i>

608
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,500
I did it! I did it!

609
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,166
Fluttershy, can you

610
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,166
believe it?

611
00:18:01,917 --> 00:18:03,041
Oh, no!

612
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,583
What did I do?

613
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,583
<i>Pinkie: Who's got something</i>

614
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:07,583
<i>valuable enough to trade</i>

615
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,208
for Princess Twilight's

616
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,208
princess books

617
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,417
that she got from

618
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,417
Princess Celestia?

619
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,542
Did I say princess?

620
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,208
Over here,

621
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:15,208
over here!

622
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:17,792
Oh, come on.

623
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:20,125
These are the books the princess

624
00:18:17,834 --> 00:18:20,125
would sit up with all night,

625
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:24,375
with nothing to read by but

626
00:18:20,166 --> 00:18:24,375
the light of her own horn.

627
00:18:24,417 --> 00:18:26,250
Ooh, now that looks fun.

628
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,834
But not fun enough.

629
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,125
These are the books that made

630
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:31,125
Twilight the princess she is.

631
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,417
<i>So who's got what it</i>

632
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,417
<i>takes to trade for them?</i>

633
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,375
When you put it

634
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,375
like that...

635
00:18:36,417 --> 00:18:38,000
<i>(giving up murmurs)</i>

636
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,500
Wait! Stop.

637
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:39,500
Come back!

638
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:41,917
These books aren't that great.

639
00:18:41,959 --> 00:18:43,500
Oh, yes they are.

640
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,208
But I thought you wanted

641
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,208
to get rid of them.

642
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,417
None of those ponies had

643
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,417
anything valuable enough

644
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,000
to trade for my books.

645
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,542
Not because these books

646
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:51,542
belonged to a princess.

647
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,750
But because they helped make me

648
00:18:51,583 --> 00:18:54,750
who I am, just like you said.

649
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,709
This is the one I was

650
00:18:55,792 --> 00:18:57,709
so absorbed in

651
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,875
the day Spike decided he

652
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,875
owed Applejack a life debt.

653
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:03,417
And this one reminds

654
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:03,417
me of the day I got it,

655
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,500
which was the day I met you.

656
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,583
I may not ever need

657
00:19:05,542 --> 00:19:07,583
to read these again,

658
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,125
but that doesn't mean

659
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,125
they don't have value.

660
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,166
I realize that now,

661
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:13,166
thanks to you, Pinkie.

662
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,834
I told you I'd take

663
00:19:13,208 --> 00:19:14,834
care of everything.

664
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:15,959
Twilight!

665
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,750
I need you to say a

666
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,750
trade wasn't fair.

667
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,792
Fast!

668
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,875
I've heard what you

669
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,875
both have to say.

670
00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,667
<i>And I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.</i>

671
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,125
But my hooves are tied.

672
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,792
You said it was a fair trade.

673
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,583
Yeah, I said it.

674
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:31,083
But I was wrong.

675
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,250
I did want that book. A lot.

676
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,166
I said I wanted it

677
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:35,166
more than anything

678
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,709
<i>in all of Equestria.</i>

679
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,834
But there's no thing that's

680
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,834
worth as much to me as a friend.

681
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:45,333
I might've forgotten that for

682
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:45,333
a little bit, but it's true.

683
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,208
Which means there's no way

684
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:48,208
this trade can be fair.

685
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,500
Oh, come on; that's...

686
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:56,375
(softens) the sweetest

687
00:19:51,542 --> 00:19:56,375
thing I've ever heard.

688
00:19:56,417 --> 00:19:58,709
OK, the trade's off.

689
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,667

declare this trial

694

It's the rustiest piece

702
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,875
of junk I could get.

703
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:40,667
Well, I took my half of

704
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:40,667
our stash and got you this.

705
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,625

713
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,333
So that should settle

714
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,333
it once and for all

715
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,166

00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,166
better friend.

Oh, come on!

718
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:59,208
You both gave up what you wanted

719
00:20:55,792 --> 00:20:59,208
to do something for each other.

720
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,041
That's the coolest

00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,041
thing a friend can do.

722
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,583
