I was saving this place

I pretty much just

19

and wave like a princess.

20
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,667
How exactly is that different

21
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,667

26
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,792
I've just been feeling a little

unsure about things lately.

new role as a princess

30
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,291

The key that represents

573
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,834
the Element of Magic.

574
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,542
My Element.

575
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,041
Oh, but I'm sure that if

576
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:15,041
we've gotten our keys,

577
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,917
you have too, Twilight.

578
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:20,250
Think, Twilight! When have you

579
00:19:16,959 --> 00:19:20,250
completed a difficult magical

580
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:24,458
task and in doing so encouraged

581
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:24,458
another pony to do the same?

582
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,834
I haven't.

583
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,333
If I had, I would have written

584
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:28,333
about it in the Journal.

585
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,875
Don't worry, Twilight, I'm sure

586
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,875
you'll get your key eventually.

588
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:39,125
What's it say?

589
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,208
That I'm needed in

590
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,208
Canterlot at once.

592
00:19:46,792 --> 00:19:48,291
I came as quickly as I could.

593
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,458
Is something wrong?

594
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,792
Is it Tirek?

595
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,458
I am afraid I put too

596
00:19:50,834 --> 00:19:53,458
much trust in Discord

597
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,792
and the effect that friendship

598
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,792
would have upon him.

599
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,333
<i>Discord has betrayed</i>

00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:02,333

601
00:20:02,375 --> 00:20:04,750

604
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,041
How could he do this?

605
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,417
I thought our friendship

606
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,417
meant something to him.

607
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,333
I thought he had changed.

608
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,166
Tirek has stolen enough magic

609
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,166
that he now has the strength

610
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,792
<i>to steal flight as well.</i>

611
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,792
Without Pegasi to

612
00:20:35,959 --> 00:20:37,792
control the weather,

613
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,917

<i>Without their strength,</i>

<i>to tend the land.</i>

620
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,166
Ponies will no longer be

621
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,166
in control of their world.

622
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,792
That power will

623
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,792
belong solely to Tirek.

624
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:02,375
There is no doubt that Tirek

625
00:20:58,834 --> 00:21:02,375
is after alicorn magic.

626
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:04,250
With Discord by his side,

627
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,917
we will not be able to

628
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:06,917
stop him from taking it.

629
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,750
Once it is in his possession,

630
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:12,667
his power will know no bounds

631
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:12,667
and all hope will be lost.

632
00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:15,041
But there is one solution.

633
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,083
It is only by making

634
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,083
this sacrifice

635
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,083
that Equestria and the lands

636
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:22,083
beyond it might be saved.

637
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,417
We must rid ourselves

638
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:26,417
of our magic

639
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,333
before Tirek has the chance

640
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:29,333
to steal it from us.
