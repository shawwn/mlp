386
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:18,291

387
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,250
Congratulations to

388
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:26,250
all our medalists.

389
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:28,250
And now, the anthem of--

390
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:30,709
And I shall do the

391

00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,041
you doing?

395
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,250
You know how they always

396
00:13:37,083 --> 00:13:39,250
just play the music?

397
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,250
Well, I know all the

398
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:41,250
words to our anthem

399
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,125
and will sing them for you

400
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:44,125
now, loud and proud,

401

403

And now, um, the Cloudsdale

404
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:56,959
anthem, as sung by Spike.

405
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,625
Wait, the Cloudsdale anthem?

406
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,166
They only play the anthem

407
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,166
for the winners, Spike.

408
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,333
The Wonderbolts are

00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:05,333
from Cloudsdale!

410
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,291
But I don't know the words

411
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:08,291

00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,333
Nah, I got this

454
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,333
stuff to pack up.

455
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,583
But you've been moping in here

456
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:44,583
for almost the entire Games.

457
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,667
And tonight's the

458
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:46,667
closing ceremony.

459
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,834
Which means we leave tomorrow.

460
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:50,834
Ergo the packing.

461
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,500
And so the Games conclude

462
00:16:01,792 --> 00:16:04,500
as they always do

463
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:07,792
with the Ice Archery finals.

464
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:11,000

466

Too bad Ponyville doesn't have

467
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,125
any ice archers competing.

468
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,875
We don't have

469
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:17,875
anyone to root for.

470
00:16:17,917 --> 00:16:19,041
It's OK.

471
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,667
Ponyville has 37 medals

472
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,667
and Cloudsdale 36,

473
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,333
so looks like we'll be medal

474
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:24,333
champs of the Games anyway!

475
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,583
Whoo hoo!

476
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,792
But Cloudsdale has two

477
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,792
ice archery finalists

478
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,542

482
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,000
comes down to this one event?

483
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,583
Pretty much.

488
00:16:43,709 --> 00:16:45,458

00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,709

495
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:51,709
Have you seen him?

496
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,875
He wouldn't come.

497
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:54,542
We tried to talk him into it.

498
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,000
But he wouldn't listen.

499
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,583
You can have his

500
00:16:56,041 --> 00:16:57,583

00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,375
It's just how I feel.

574
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,750
Wait a second. I

575
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:53,750
think I get it.

576
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,792
You keep saying you

577
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:55,792
let everypony down.

578
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,709
But we all keep

579
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,709
saying you didn't.

580
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,458
You know who was disappointed

581
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,458
in you, Spike? You.

582
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,083
<i>And only you can make</i>

583
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,083
<i>it right with you again.</i>

584
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,000
<i>What would that take, Spike?</i>

585
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,750
I don't know. Can

586
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:09,750
you turn back time?

587
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,041
Cause I'd sure like a do-over

588
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:13,041
on that opening ceremony.

589
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:15,083
We can't turn back time.

590
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,083
But would you do me

591
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:18,083
the great honor

592
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,041
<i>of lighting fireworks</i>

593
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,041
<i>in my place</i>

594
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,291
<i>at the closing</i>

595
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,291
<i>ceremonies tonight?</i>

596
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,542
Come on, Spike.

597
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,125
You've saved the

598
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:26,125
Crystal Empire. Twice.

599
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,125
I think you can

600
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,125
light some fireworks.

601
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:33,500
I guess I have to at

602
00:20:30,959 --> 00:20:33,500
least give it a shot.

603
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:36,000
<i>(happy chatter)</i>

604
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:41,125
<i>(cheering)</i>

605
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,250
We did it!

606
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,166
Ponyville won the medal count!

607
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,125
And only by one medal.

608
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,709
Hmm. Wonder which

609
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:49,709
medal that was?

610
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,625
Bam!

611
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,083
How's it feel to have opened

612
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,083
the best Equestria Games

613
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,041
in Ponyville history, Squirt?

614
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,208
Probably as good as it

615
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,208
feels to close them.

616
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,417
OK, it's time.

617
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,375
<i>Spike: You know,</i>

618
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,375
<i>it's kinda weird;</i>

619
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,792
<i>no matter how many times others</i>

620
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:11,792
<i>tell you you're great,</i>

621
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,625
<i>all the praise in</i>

622
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,625
<i>the world means nothing</i>

623
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:15,041
<i>if you don't feel it inside.</i>

624
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,125
<i>Sometimes, to feel</i>

625
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:22,125
<i>good about yourself,</i>

626
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,041
<i>you've got to let</i>

627
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:24,041
<i>go of the past.</i>

628
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,792
<i>That way, when the time comes</i>

629
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,792
<i>to let your greatness fly,</i>

630
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:30,667
<i>you'll be able to</i>

631
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:30,667
<i>light up the whole sky.</i>
