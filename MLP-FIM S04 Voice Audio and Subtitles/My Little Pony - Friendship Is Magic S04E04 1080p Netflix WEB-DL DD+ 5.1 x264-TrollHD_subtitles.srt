author A.K. Yearling

127
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,583

I'm just as big a fan as you.

In fact, I'm the one who first

introduced you to the books.

00:03:35,834 --> 00:03:37,041
Oh. Right.

138
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,458
A.K. Yearling just might

139
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,458
be my favorite author.

140
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,041
I know everything about her.

141
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,041
Where she grew up.

142
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,709
Where she studied literature.

143
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,000
Where she wrote

144
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,000
the first Daring Do book...

145
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:47,417
Where she lives?

146
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:48,917
Uh, no...

147
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,375
though I could probably

148
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,375
find out somehow.

149
00:03:51,417 --> 00:03:52,625

Don't you get it?

151
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,792
The new book is obviously

152
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,792
delayed because she needs help

153
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:59,542
dealing with whatever everyday

154
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:59,542

laundry, buying her groceries,

163
00:04:11,917 --> 00:04:12,875
