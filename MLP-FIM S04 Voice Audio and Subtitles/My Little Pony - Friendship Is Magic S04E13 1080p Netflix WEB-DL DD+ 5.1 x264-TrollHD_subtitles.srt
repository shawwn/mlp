Please.

193
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:01,959
Call me Trend.

194
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,834
<i>(thud)</i>

195
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,166
And over here will be the

196
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:11,166
climax of the Festival,

197
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,166
The Ponyville Days Gala.

198
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,333
Music. Dancing.

199
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,709
And of course a locally sourced

200
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,709
menu of delicious treats.

201
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,375
Reminds me of the Spring Fling

202
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,375
meets Manehattan Wedding

203
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,333
I wrote about in

204
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:23,333
Gallop & Prance.

205
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,083
Exactly! I can't

206
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:26,083
even describe

207
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,458
how much your work

208
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,458
has influenced me.

209
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:35,375
And finally, Sweet Apple Acres.

210
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:38,208
Ponyville's core, heh

211
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:38,208
heh, so to speak,

212
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,792

213
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,792

<i>Trend: Oh! Breathtaking!</i>

215
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,959
I've heard about it, of course,

216
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,959
but to see it in verite,

217
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,458
to stand on the soil

218
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,458
of a working farm.

219
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,667
You can really feel

220
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,667
the authenticity.

221
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,458
Oh yes! Uh, they really

222
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,458
do grow apples here.

223
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,166
Thank you, Rarity.

224
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,959
Thank you for

225
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,959
bringing me here.

226
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,709
This farm is truly

227
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,709
something special.

228
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,667
I had planned to transform it

229
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:07,667
into an elegant country inn

230
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,583
for the Festival,

231
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,625
but now I see just how

232
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,625
special it is<i> au natural.</i>

233
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,458

244
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,959

Rarity, what's wrong?

00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,792
Nothing.

He doesn't like me.

265
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,500
Rarity, I can't hear--

266
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,667
HE DOESN'T LIKE ME BECAUSE

267
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,667
HE HAS A CRUSH ON APPLEJACK

268
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:40,875

ever know what it's like

277
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:53,667

00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,458
they're obsessed

Hmmm.

286
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,375
You know, I have such

287
00:09:10,792 --> 00:09:13,375
respect for the work ethic

288
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:15,250
of Earth Ponies.

289
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,583
Uh, gee, thanks.

290
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,166
Granny Smith always said,

291
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,166
"Pick an apple a day

292
00:09:20,208 --> 00:09:21,917
and keep trouble away."

293
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,041
How many varieties of

294
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:25,041
apples do you think there are?

295
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,250
On the farm or in all

296
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,250
of Equestria because--

297
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,417
I once had

298
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,417
an apple so rare,

299
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,792
they thought it

300
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:30,792
was extinct.

301
00:09:30,834 --> 00:09:32,041
I ate four of them.

302
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,291
(chomp)

303
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,000
Is that a fact?

304
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,458
That's my thing.

305
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,709
I take the mundane,

306
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,709
the simple, the...

307
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,417
unappreciated, and

308
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,417
I make it relatable.

309
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,583
Well, I hope you can

310
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,583
relate to Ponyville.

311
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,959
Me too.

312
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,250
But enough about me.

313
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,709
I want to know about you.

314
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,834
What do apples

315
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,834
mean to Applejack?

316
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,000
Look, I'm glad you're

317
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:56,000
interested in Ponyville and all,

318
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,417
but I'm kinda busy

319
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:58,417
with my chores

320
00:09:58,458 --> 00:10:00,041
and if I can't get 'em done,

321
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,875
there won't be a

323
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:03,375

327
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:11,875
What, this old thing?

328
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,750

329
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:13,750

330
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,625

331
00:10:13,792 --> 00:10:15,625
outfits for it?

332
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:19,333
I am, but the thought of

333
00:10:15,667 --> 00:10:19,333
hauling apples inspired me

334
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,417

want to plow a field?

356
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,125

Yes, yes. Of course.

Well, if you're still

389

I can teach you all about it.

390
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,208

Now, Rarity, you be careful.

I believe a certain amount

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,792
of style is required.

410

575
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:13,250
Goodness! Your couture!

576
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,750
Oh, it's bad.

577
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,083
Will somepony

578
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:18,083
bring me a towel

579
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,959
to wipe this repulsive

580
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:20,959
filth from my hooves!

581
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,083
There's the Rarity I know!

582
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,959
Oh, Applejack, I'm sorry

583
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,959
I said all those things.

584
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,959
You're a true friend who

585
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,959
probably knows me better

586
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,792
than I know myself.

587
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:34,333
I don't know what I was thinking

588
00:19:30,834 --> 00:19:34,333
wearing this ridiculous outfit.

589
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,417
I kinda know how you feel.

590
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,500
But you were just trying to help

591
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:39,500
me see how silly I was being.

592
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,291
And you were right.

593
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,583
<i>(sigh)</i>

594
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,917
Besides, that gown

595
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,917
looks just gorgeous on you.

596
00:19:44,959 --> 00:19:47,125
I wish I hadn't ruined it.

597
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,125
Thanks. It's

598
00:19:47,166 --> 00:19:49,125
nice ain't it?

599
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:50,625
It's magnificent!

600
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,417
Wherever did

601
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:52,417
you get it?

602
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,875
Oh. It's uh... one of yours.

603
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,458
I'll need 3 gallons of boiling

604
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,458
water and one ounce of detergent

605
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,542
STAT!

606
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:04,166
<i>(ahem)</i>

607
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:07,500
I'm moving to Ponyville!

608
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:11,333
Being the most interesting Pony

609
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:11,333
in Equestria is exhausting.

610
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,000
I want to leave my exotic,

611
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,000
exciting life behind

612
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:16,250
and live on a farm.

613
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,834
Both: What?

614
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,709
Well, that's real nice, but I

615
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:20,709
sure hope you weren't thinking

616
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,625
of Sweet Apple Acres.

617
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:25,083
Oh.

618
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:29,542
Look, you're a fine

619
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:29,542
pony, but uh, well, I'm...

620
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,208
I think what Applejack

621
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:32,208
is trying to say,

622
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,667
is that there's something

623
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,667
unappealing about a pony

624
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:38,166
who'd change themselves so much

625
00:20:34,709 --> 00:20:38,166
just to impress somepony else.

626
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:42,208
If somepony doesn't like you for

627
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:42,208
who you are, it's their loss.

628
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,875
Well, this is awkward.

629
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:46,959
Not at all.

630
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,291
In fact...

631
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,750
I think I know

632
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,750
just how you feel.

633
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,250
What do you think, Rarity?

634
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,166
Is it too late to go

635
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:55,166
back to Small Town Chic?

636
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,542
Not if I can help it!
