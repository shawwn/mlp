I'm sorry, Fluttershy,

200

201
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,458

204
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,250

205
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,792

206
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:49,792

207
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,166

208
00:05:49,834 --> 00:05:52,166
the rest of my orchard.

209
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,667
Fruit bat round up!

210
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,667
Fruit bat round up!

211
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:58,667
Um, excuse me, but what if

212
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:58,667
instead of rounding them up,

213
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,667
we let them have part

214
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,667

217
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,333

218
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:08,333
because they're hungry.

219
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,291
If we built a

220
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,291

221
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,375
they could have their

00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,375

223
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,083
After a while, they

224
00:06:12,417 --> 00:06:14,083

225
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,000

226
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:18,959
The Vampire bats don't eat

227

228
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,417
and when they

229
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,417

230
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,667

231
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:23,667

234
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,291

235
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,834

236
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,834

237
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:33,333

254

of my worries.

577
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,125
I just want my

578
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,125
friend back.

579
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,125
We'll never get her back

580
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:09,125
unless we corner her

581
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,166
and catch her so I can

582
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:11,166
reverse the spell.

583
00:18:13,208 --> 00:18:17,000
<i>(wolf howl)</i>

584
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,041
There she is.

585
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,709
<i>(whoosh)</i>

586
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,917
There she goes!

587
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,250
Oh, this is no use.

588
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,291
I think the only way we're

589
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,291
going to catch her

590
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,917
is if we find a way to

591
00:18:29,333 --> 00:18:31,917
lure her closer to us.

592
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,959
But even if we can

593
00:18:31,959 --> 00:18:33,959
lure her to us,

594
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,583
how are we going to get

595
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,583
her to stay still long enough

596
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,250
for you to do

597
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,250
your reverse spell?

598
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,917
Oooh! If only we had

599
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,917
Fluttershy to do her stare

600
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:42,542
on the Flutterbat.

601
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,792
(gasp) That's

602
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,792
it!

603
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,166
OK, let's get

604
00:18:49,917 --> 00:18:52,166
our friend back.

605
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,333
Action stations!

606
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,208
So much for having

607
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:57,208
the winning apple

608
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,625
in the Appaloosa

609
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,625
State Fair, huh?

610
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:00,667
<i>(sigh)</i>

611
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:08,000
<i>(whistling wind)</i>

612
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:12,250
<i>(sniffing)</i>

613
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:15,792
<i>(hiss)</i>

614
00:19:15,834 --> 00:19:16,959
She's coming!

615
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,458
<i>(zap)</i>

616
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:54,542
Where am I?

617
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,625
<i>(cheers and shouts)</i>

618
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,709
Thank goodness you're OK!

619
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,458
But what happened to me?

620
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,458
You turned into

621
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,458
a vampire pony!

622
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
I tried to eat ponies?

623
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,125
Of course not.

624
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:09,542
So I wasn't a vampire?

625
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,542
Yes!

626
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,542
"Yes," I was?

627
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:12,750
Or "Yes," I wasn't?

628
00:20:12,792 --> 00:20:14,166
Yes, you were!

629
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,000
But I didn't try

630
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,000
to eat ponies?

631
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,000
Yes!

632
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:18,000
I did?

633
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:19,000
No.

634
00:20:19,041 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm confused.

635
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:22,417
Me too, and I was there.

636
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,792
Fluttershy, I'm real sorry I

637
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,792
didn't take your suggestion

638
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:34,750
in the first place.

639
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:37,083
And don't forget; now

640
00:20:34,792 --> 00:20:37,083
you'll get seeds that will

641
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,709
grow into even bigger

642
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:40,709
and better apple trees.

643
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,333
Does that mean what

644
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,333
I think it means?

645
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,834
Yep. More cider, too.

646
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,166
Ha ha! Wow!

647
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,917

651
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,083
Building the sanctuary.

652
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,959
Be sure to put in there

653
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,959
that I came to see that my

654
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,834
short-term solution was

655
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,834
a little short-sighted.

656
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,834
And that you shouldn't let

657
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,834
anypony pressure you

658
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,250
into doing something you

659
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:06,250
don't think is right.

660
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,917
Sometimes you have to tell

661
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:09,917
even your closest friends, "no".
