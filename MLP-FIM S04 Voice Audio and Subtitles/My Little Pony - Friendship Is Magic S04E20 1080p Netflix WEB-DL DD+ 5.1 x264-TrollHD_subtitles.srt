Well, I looked out at

the water this morning

294
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:01,166

Well, then even if our tonic

380
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,667
were nothing more than a mixture

381
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,000
of apple juice

382
00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:46,000
and beet leaves...

383
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:47,041
Hypothetically.

384
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,083
Theoretically.

385
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,250
The fact is that

386
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,250
Granny is happier now

387
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,834
than before she tried it.

388
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:56,417
I guess.

389
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:58,166
So, the question is...

390
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,041
Do you really want

391
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:00,041
to be the pony

392
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,834
who takes all that

393
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,834
happiness away?

394
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,208
I...

395
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,417
There you are!

396
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,917
I've been looking

397
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,917
all over.

398
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,709
Did you find out

399
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,709
what's in the tonic?

400
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,208
Honestly, Apple Bloom,

401
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:18,208
as long as it works,

402
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,458
I don't suppose

403
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,458
it really matters.

404
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,291
Well, if it doesn't

405
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,291
matter to you,

406
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,375
then it doesn't matter

407
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:26,375
to me either, sis.

408
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,291
That's the spirit!

409
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,792
Come back anytime!

410
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,959
Hey Granny, think you can

411
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,959
buck me over the water?

412
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,834
I don't see why not.

413
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,417
Come on, Big Mac,

414
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:43,417
toss her this way.

415
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:44,709
Granny, wait!

416
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:47,083

Granny, don't you think you

420
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:56,083
should take it kinda easy?

421
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,625
I've been taking it

422
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,625
easy for too long

423
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,917
and now, thanks to that Flim

424
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,917
Flam tonic, I don't have to.

425
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,583
Granny, do you think I could

426
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:05,583
be an aqua-pony like you?

427
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,750
Of course you can, sapling.

Well, the Ponyville

431
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:13,291
swim meet is coming up.

432
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,667
We could enter together.

435
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,166
We'd be a cinch to win.

436
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,041
Hmmm. I don't know.

437
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,250
Being back in the

438
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,250
water is one thing,

439
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,000
but a competition is a

440
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,000
pony of a different color.

441
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,709
Oh. OK.

442
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:35,083
I don't know, Granny.

443
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,125
A swim meet sounds pretty safe.

444
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,000
And after all, if that tonic

445
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,000
lets you swim in a river

446
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,667
and a swimming hole, a pool

447
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:43,667
should be no problem at all.

448
00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:46,583

a dive ten times as high.

572
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,375
Twenty times by

573
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:49,375
my count.

574
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,125
Thirty with a

575
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,125
favorable breeze.

576
00:18:54,250 --> 00:19:02,792
<i>♪ (celestial) ♪</i>

577
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,667
I hate to disappoint

578
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:04,667
everypony,

579
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,959
but there's no way Granny

580
00:19:04,709 --> 00:19:06,959
could have made that dive

581
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,625
because this

582
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,625
tonic is a fake.

583
00:19:09,667 --> 00:19:11,125
<i>(group gasp)</i>

584
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,375
But you gave it your

585
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,375
stamp of approval!

586
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:14,792
Are you saying you lied?

587
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,250
I am.

588
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,917
<i>(gasp)</i>

589
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,291
I didn't mean to.

590
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,458
But everypony seemed

591
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:23,458
so much happier,

592
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,083
<i>I couldn't bring</i>

593
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,083
<i>myself to tell you</i>

594
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,041
<i>when I found out the</i>

595
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,041
<i>tonic wasn't real.</i>

596
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:30,709
I know it was wrong.

597
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,250
I just hope, with time, I can

598
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,250
win back everypony's trust.

599
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,834
But if the tonic is a fake then

600
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:39,834
how come Granny can swim again

601
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,917
and what about all that

602
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,917
aqua-batic stuff we just did?

603
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:46,041
I reckon sometimes you can

604
00:19:42,959 --> 00:19:46,041
forget what you're capable of

605
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,291
and it just takes a little

606
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,291
extra confidence to remember

607
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,417
that it was inside

608
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:50,417
of you all along.

609
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,291
But telling ponies your tonic

610
00:19:51,792 --> 00:19:54,291
can do things it can't

611
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,917
is just wrong!

612
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,333
But you just said it

613
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,333
boosts confidence!

614
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,959
And that's not all it

615
00:19:58,375 --> 00:19:59,959
does, folks--

616
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,250
<i>Yes it is!</i>

617
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,959
In fact, it's not

618
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,959
a tonic at all.

619
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,083
I know because I

620
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,083
helped make it.

621
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,583
Watching Applejack save Granny

622
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,583
and then admit to lying,

623
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,834
well, that made me realize

624
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:14,834
I was making ponies believe

625
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,417
in a thing that

626
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,417
just wasn't so.

627
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,250
Believing in something can

628
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:20,250
help you do amazing things,

629
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,750
but if that belief

630
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,750
is based on a lie,

631
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:26,041
<i>eventually it's going to</i>

632
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:26,041
<i>lead to real trouble.</i>

633
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:28,625
Thank you, Applejack.

634
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:31,083
I got this through

635
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:31,083
dishonest means.

636
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,583
<i>That was a mistake I</i>

637
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,583
<i>won't be making again.</i>

638
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:37,125
I'd like you to have it.

639
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:41,041
As a reminder of how you helped

640
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:41,041
me finally see the truth.

641
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,375
I don't know.

642
00:20:42,417 --> 00:20:43,834
Oh, don't worry.

643
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,500
I'll track down the pony I

644
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,500
sold that worthless tonic to

645
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,917
and give them another bit

646
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:48,917
to replace this one.

647
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:50,834
Honest.

648
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,500
I'm sorry, Granny.

649
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,583
I hope this doesn't mean

650
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,583
you'll stop swimming.

651
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,125
Why in tarnation

652
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:57,125
would I do that?

653
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,291
I just can't believe

654
00:20:57,166 --> 00:20:59,291
those two salesponies

655
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,375
had me believing

656
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,375
I could near fly.

657
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:04,083
