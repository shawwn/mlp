206
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:35,709
What? No! I was riveted by

The original Wonderbolts

Rainbow Dash.

220
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,792
You could have hurt me.

221
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:57,458
With a spit wad? Really?

222
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,125
A spit wad to the eye would

Ernie's Undercooked Pancakes.

out of my desire to help you.

433
00:11:37,959 --> 00:11:39,000
Good luck.

434
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,125
Get ready, Rainbow Dash,

435
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:44,125
for I am going to take you

436
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:48,583
on an historical

437
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:48,583
adventure in fashion.

438
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,542
I am now modeling the rather

439
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,542

440
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:56,208
itchy original Wonderbolts'

441
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:56,208
flying costume.

442
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,500
Fortunately, thanks to the

443
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,500
vision of Flair de Mare,

444
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,458
the Wonderbolts ensemble

445
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:02,458
became more streamlined

446
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,792
in a wonderfully

447
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,792
breathable fabric.

448
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,250
Of course, there were

449
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:08,250
fashion hits and misses.

450

00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,125
Ah! Pinkie! You're real!

457
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,291
Of course I'm real.

458
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,041
I mean, I'm not the

460
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,667
the 10th leader of

00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,667
the Wonderbolts.

462
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:26,834
But I, Pinkie, am really real.

463
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:31,458
And I'm Admiral Fairy Flight,

464
00:12:26,875 --> 00:12:31,458
from the 7th squadron.

465
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,417
And of course, you recognize

466
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,417
Commander Easy Glider.

467
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,250
And I'm sportin' some

468
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,250
sort of get-up worn

469
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:38,291
by Colonel Purple Dart.

470
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,667
<i>(frightened gasps)</i>

Look at me!

474
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:45,792
It's too much for my eyes!

475
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:47,917
Now, don't you fret, Rainbow.

476
00:12:47,959 --> 00:12:49,250
This fashion show nonsense

477
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,834
wouldn't help me

478
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,834
learn nothin' either.

479
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,000

480
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,625
Well, what special study

482
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:57,834

483
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:58,834

Aw.

485
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,917
Why, I could tell you every

486
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,917
little thing there is to know

487
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,458
about the history of Apples.

488
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,917
But I picked all that up

489
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,917
over years in the field

490
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,458
as a labor of love.

491
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,083
How much time you got?

492
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:11,417
Twelve hours.

493
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,458
Oh, then you are up a creek.

494
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,125
Well, I think we should just go

495
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,125
back to old-fashioned studying.

496
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,333
What about our play?

497
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,750
Just look at these costumes.
