or trip on a loose stone.

195
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:35,625
You have to be careful.

196
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,458
SPIKE: I don't think I'll need

197
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,458
all these candles, Twilight.

198
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,291
I was really only

199
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,291
scared for a second.

200
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,959
Oh, these aren't

201
00:05:45,333 --> 00:05:46,959
for you, Spike.

202
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,792
We're going to be studying

203
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,792
late into the night

204
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,875
and we're going to need

205
00:05:48,834 --> 00:05:50,875
all the light we can get.

206
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,208
Oh. Great.

207
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:56,917
APPLEJACK: Well? Here we are!

208
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,875
What's so daring

209
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,875
about this place?

210
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,291
This is where we got the

211
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:02,291
Elements of Harmony.

212
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,000
When I was just a filly,

213
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,000
Grannie Smith told me

214
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:06,750
of an ancient legend...

215
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,000
When Nightmare

216
00:06:06,792 --> 00:06:09,000
Moon was banished,

217
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:12,583
not every last bit of her

218
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:12,583
dark magic went with her.

219
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,834
<i>Grannie used to say when</i>

220
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:16,834
<i>night falls on the Castle,</i>

221
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:20,000
that magic takes the form of...

222
00:06:20,041 --> 00:06:23,125
THE PONY HOOF SHADOWS.

223
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,125
You mean like a ghost?

224

225
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:28,834
No pony knows.

00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:29,875
Ugh!

00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:38,000
Well, it certainly could

230
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:38,000
use some restoration.

231

daring about an old legend.

Oh, my dear, I

am so sorry.

258
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,959
That tapestry is

259
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,959
far too heavy.

260
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,917
We'll just have to

261

find a smaller one.

262
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:37,083
Oh. Of course.

00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,208
Where, pray tell, did

00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:39,208
you disappear to?

265
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,834
What do you mean?

266
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,583
While you were struggling

267
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,583
under that fabric,

the entire wall

You must have activated

a secret door.

00:07:46,792 --> 00:07:49,083
Oh, I'm sorry.

273
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,917
I suppose these ruins

274
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:51,917
are chock-full of them.

275
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,000
Really?

276
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,083
Absolutely.

277
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,083

RAINBOW DASH: OK. So

283
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:05,333
maybe the legend is true.

284
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,250
Well, that's why I

285
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,250
brought you here.

286
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:09,500
I guess only the most

288
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,000

I'm not scared.

Well, me neither!

Then it's settled.

Whoever stays in the Castle the

00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:25,250
longest is the Most Daring Pony.

299
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:27,792

Me, too.

no place for a bunny.

348
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:07,041
He could get hit

totally play the organ?

See? What did I tell you?

I thought you had to ring

00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,750
the school bell all week.

595
00:18:59,792 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh, yeah.

596
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,625
I only had to ring

597
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,625
it for like, five minutes.

598
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,834
They said that was good enough.

599

I can't imagine why.

601
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,208
So, then I decided to throw a

Finished Ringing The

School Bell party,

604
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,792
but I didn't have

605
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,792
any bluebells

606
00:19:13,834 --> 00:19:15,667
and you can't throw a Finished

Ringing The School Bell party

608
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:18,041
without bluebells so I went to

609
00:19:15,709 --> 00:19:18,041
Everfree forest to pick some,

610
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,500
but it started to

611
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,500
get so chilly

612
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,917
I had to wrap myself up in

613
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,917
the tarp I was going to use

614
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:23,000
to carry the flowers.

615
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,125
And then I saw

616
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,125
Fluttershy and Rarity,

617
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,291
but they went into the Castle

618
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,917
before I could invite

619
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,917
them to my party.

620
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,542
Luckily, I followed

621
00:19:26,959 --> 00:19:28,542
them inside

622
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,625
so I could help you all

623
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,625
with your party.

624
00:19:30,667 --> 00:19:32,417
What party is that?

625
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,709
Uh, The Everypony Come To

626
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,709
The Scary Old Castle

627
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,792
And Hide From Each Other While

I swear this is going right

633
00:19:48,834 --> 00:19:51,208
back where I found it

634
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,667
just as soon as I've returned

635
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,667
it to its former glory.

636
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:57,375
Now don't go running off again.

637
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:00,166
Ooh. I can't believe I

638
00:19:57,417 --> 00:20:00,166
was so frightened.

639
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,875
I guess I let my imagination

640
00:20:00,208 --> 00:20:02,875
get the best of me.

641
00:20:02,917 --> 00:20:04,750
I think we all did.

642
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,208
I always let my imagination

643
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:07,208
run away from me.

644
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,333
Then it comes back with cake.

645
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,542
Well, it's good to know that

646
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,542
whenever your imagination

647
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:17,208
is getting away from you, a good

friend can help you rein it in.

649
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,875
And even though I didn't

650
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,875
find anything out

651
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,792
about the mysterious chest,

652
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,041
I'm glad I was here to

653
00:20:20,834 --> 00:20:23,041
help all of you.

654
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,166
You certainly did

655
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,166
that, Twilight.

656
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,542
Yeah, why weren't you scared?

657
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,250
Reading Celestia's diary

658
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:31,250
made it hard to be afraid

659
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,166
because I knew what it was like

660
00:20:31,291 --> 00:20:34,166
when she and Luna lived here.

661
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,625
Knowing something

662
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:35,625
about the past

663
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,166
made it easier to deal with my

664
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,166
problems in the present,

665
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,208
even the scary ones.

<i>(murmurs of agreement)</i>

667
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,417
I just thought of a great idea!

668
00:20:46,458 --> 00:20:47,917
Why don't we keep a journal?

669
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,166
Just like the Royal

670
00:20:47,959 --> 00:20:50,166
Pony Sisters?

671
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,208
All of us?

672
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,834
Sure! That way we can

673
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,834
learn from each other.

674
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,083
And maybe someday other

675
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:57,083
ponies will read it

676
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:58,750
and learn something too.

677
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,125
What a splendid idea!

678
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,500
I know what my

679
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,500
first entry will be.

680
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:08,250
Dear Diary, I'm glad Grannie

681
00:21:03,542 --> 00:21:08,250
Smith's legend wasn't true.

682
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,917
Me too.

683
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,333
Me three, because

684
00:21:09,959 --> 00:21:12,333
that means you two

685
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,709
are still tied for

686
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:15,709
Most Daring Pony!

687
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,458
