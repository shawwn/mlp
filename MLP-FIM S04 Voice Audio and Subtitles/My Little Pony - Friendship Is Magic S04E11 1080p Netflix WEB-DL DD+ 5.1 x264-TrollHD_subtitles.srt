195
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,166
Oh, Rainbow Dash,

196
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:42,166
I've changed!

197
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,000
Surely you remember

198
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,000
I was reformed

199
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:50,250
by lovely little Fluttershy!

200
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,375

203
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:54,417
Sick or somethin'?

204
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,750
Well, of course I'm sick!

205
00:05:56,792 --> 00:05:58,834
The blue skin?

206
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,417
These sneezes?

207
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,750
Could somebody find

208
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:02,750
me a fainting couch?

209
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:06,917
What?

210
00:06:10,333 --> 00:06:12,625
Charming, thank you.

211
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,000
I can't stop sneezing

212
00:06:12,667 --> 00:06:15,000
and wheezing.

213
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:17,750
In short, I need help.

214
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,458
If you're so sick, why have

215
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,458
you come here instead of...

216
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,834
y'know, staying home in bed and

217
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,834
getting over your weird illness?

218
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,250
Achoo!

219
00:06:28,291 --> 00:06:30,333
<i>(honk)</i>

220
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,208
Because this condition

221
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:33,208
has left me helpless.

222
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,083
Simply helpless.

223
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:40,709
Why, I can barely lift a spoon.

224

<i>(crash)</i>

225
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,458
I came to find the one pony

226
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:47,458
who truly understands me

227
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,333
and could nurse me

228
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,333

229
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,834
Where is that dear,

230
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,834
sweet Fluttershy.

231
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,250
I need attention!

232
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:55,792
I need some care!

233
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:56,959
I need...

234
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,917
You need to chill!

235
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,375
Fluttershy's out.

236
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:01,750
Oh, of course.

237
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,667
Her trip to see the

238
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:03,667
Breezies.

239
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,125
Ah yes, I had forgotten

240
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:06,125
that was today.

241
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,542
How do you know

242
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,542
about her trip?

243
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,250
She told me about

244
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:11,250
it in her last letter.

245
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,917
You and Fluttershy write

246
00:07:12,792 --> 00:07:14,917
each other letters?

247
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,208
Of course we do.

248
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,500
We're friends.

that today of all days

252
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,750
is when I really need her.

253
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,834
Oh, well. I know

254
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,834
what to do.

255
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,375
Good thinking, head on

256
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,375
home, put your feet up.

257
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,917
I'm sure eventually

258
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,917
you'll have the strength

259
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,333
to make yourself

00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,333

No, no, no.

262
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,917
I mean while she's gone, you

263
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:37,917
ponies can take care of me.

264
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:40,000
Isn't that what

Taking care of

each other?

00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:46,208
Let the healing begin!

Don't you worry, Discord,

275
00:07:54,333 --> 00:07:56,291
I'll give you cuddles

276
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,625
and read stories and

277
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,625
tell you all about me!

278
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,291
I was born on a Tuesday....

279
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,709
You're so sweet to offer.

280
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,750
But Rarity and Applejack

281
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,750
already volunteered

282
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,583
to be my own personal

283
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:07,583
nursemaids!

284
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,667
We did?

285
00:08:09,709 --> 00:08:12,750
I SO hope you don't

fact, I most certainly...

289
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:20,542
Hey! Who keeps throwing away

290
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:20,542
these perfectly good balloons?

291
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,208
That joker's

gonna keep it as far away

295
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,625
from Twilight and Princess

296
00:08:24,834 --> 00:08:26,625
Cadance as possible.

We promised we wouldn't let

300
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,125
anything ruin their visit.

301
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,500
Although I do so wish that

302
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:35,500
"anything" had turned out

303
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,291
to be something else.

304
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,750
Did I hear you two talking about

305
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,750
Princess Cadance's visit

306
00:08:40,792 --> 00:08:43,125
with Princess Twilight?

307
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,834
Maybe.

308
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,792
Fluttershy had mentioned

309
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,792
that those two

310
00:08:46,834 --> 00:08:48,583
were getting together today.

311
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,667
How wonderful for them both.

312
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:53,667
It is so rare that those two

313
00:08:50,709 --> 00:08:53,667
get to see one another.

314
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,083
I don't know about you, but I

315
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:56,083
sometimes wonder how close

316
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,542
they could actually be.

317
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,417
<i>All those years apart</i>

318
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:01,417
<i>before being reunited?</i>

319
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,250
They're plenty close.

320
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,542
And if they're not, this rare

321
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:05,542
opportunity to focus

322
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,333
on their friendship will

323
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,333
certainly bring them closer.

324
00:09:08,375 --> 00:09:09,333
Unless...

325
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,500
Don't even

326
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,500
think about it.

327
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,083
They mustn't be disturbed.

328
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:13,375
Disturb them?

329
00:09:13,417 --> 00:09:14,709
Why I wouldn't dream of it.

330
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,125
Not when I have two such

said to myself I said.

660

663
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,125

697
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,834
relaxation is the

698
