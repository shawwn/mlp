195
00:05:50,542 --> 00:05:51,834
we should.

196
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,959
Won't you two excuse

197
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:53,959
us for a moment?

198
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,166
We should totally say yes.

199
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,750
This is a golden opportunity!

200
00:05:59,792 --> 00:06:01,291
Are you kidding?

201
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,375
I don't want them laughing at

202
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,375
us while I'm mixin' potions

203
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:06,125
and accidentally sendin'

204
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:06,125
plants into choking fits!

205
00:06:06,166 --> 00:06:07,291
But don't you get it?

206
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,750
They'll have to

207
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,750
learn something, too.

208
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,000
And they won't be able to laugh

209
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:14,000
at us when they're so busy

210
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,834
trying to learn

211
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,834
stuff of their own.

212
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,709
I must admit it's kinda fun

213
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,709
to see them working hard

214
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,750
to get on our good

215
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,750
side for a change

216
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,500
<i>Diamond Tiara: Oh my gosh, a</i>

217
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:27,500
<i>princess lives in there.</i>

218
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,542
And I'm about to go

219
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:29,542
inside and see her!

220
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,000
I can't even tell

221
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:32,000
you how excited I am!

222
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:33,250
I can't either!

223
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,125
<i>(knock knock)</i>

224
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,166
Now remember, Twilight takes

225
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,166
this time out with us

226
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:40,667
so we can learn stuff.

227
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,417
Hey there, guys!

228
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:42,417
Come on in.

229
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,792
<i>(swooning screams)</i>

230
00:06:43,834 --> 00:06:46,291
Princess Twilight!

231
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,125
Oh! It's really her!

232
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:49,959
Oh my gosh! I don't believe it!

233
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,417
Oh, and uh, you

234
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,417
brought guests.

235
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,000
Great.

236
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,458
Princess Twilight, it is such

237
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:58,458
a thrill and honor to be here,

238
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,750
you have no idea.

239
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:02,375
Oh my gosh, who dyes your tail?

240
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,166
I so have to

241
00:07:02,417 --> 00:07:04,166
get that done.

242
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,834
Actually, it's not dyed.

243
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:07,250
I've always--

244
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,875
<i>Diamond Tiara: (gasp) Are</i>

245
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,875
<i>those books in there?</i>

246
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,917
What a bold design choice.

247
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,375
You should so do that, Di.

248
00:07:13,417 --> 00:07:15,458
I know, right?

249
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,417
Listen. I'm all for helping

250
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,417
as many ponies as I can,

251
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,166
but maybe we should keep

252
00:07:19,458 --> 00:07:21,166
these weekly visits

253
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:22,709
just between us, hm?

254
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,625
OK, which one of you

255
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,625
wants to practice first?

256
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,083
Shouldn't they go first?

257
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,542
No silly, I set up Twilight

258
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,542
Time especially for you.

259
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,083
Applebloom, go ahead.

260
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,875
Let's see how your plant

261
00:07:37,125 --> 00:07:38,875
potions are coming.

262
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,041
I can't believe I

263
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,041
let you talk us

264
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,667
into bringing

265
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,667
guests yesterday.

266
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:52,333
I didn't hear them laugh

267
00:07:49,709 --> 00:07:52,333
at us once, Applebloom.

268
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,083
Because they laughed

269
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,083
on the inside.

270
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,208
Don't worry.

271
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,125
We won't make that

272
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,125
same mistake again.

273
00:07:57,917 --> 00:07:59,208
Oh great.

274
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,875
Look who showed up

275
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:01,875
to make fun of us.

276
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,917
So much for learning

277
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:04,917
skills to be big shots.

278
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:06,583
Hey, guess what!

279
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:10,458
I told everyone about your

280
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:10,458
special Twilight time!

281
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,291
Oh no, here it comes.

282
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,375
And they all want in!

283
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:21,333
Twilight Time! Twilight Time!

284
00:08:15,417 --> 00:08:21,333
(continues)

285
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,834
Thanks to me, you three are

286
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:24,834
now the hottest thing around.

287
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,458
You're welcome.

288
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,125
Twilight Time! Twilight Time!

289
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,125
Twilight Time!

290
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,417
Uh oh.

291
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:35,291
Twilight time! Twilight time!

292
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,125
Wow! All these ponies really

293
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,125
want to meet Twilight

294
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,041
that badly?

295
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,750
We love you, Cutie

296
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,750

297
00:08:42,792 --> 00:08:46,667
<i>(cheers)</i>

<i>now, everypony.</i>

300
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,208
Demanding time with a

301
00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:52,208
Princess as an unruly mob

302
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,333
simply won't do.

303
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,834
Might I suggest you get

304
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,834
organized through us,

305
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:01,250
the Cutie Mark Crusaders'

306
00:08:56,875 --> 00:09:01,250
nearest and dearest friends?

307
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,667
Everypony get in line.

308
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,417
No pushing. No pushing!

<i>(excited shouts)</i>

310
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:09,500
What a mess.

311
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,166
Of awesome!

312
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,417
Don't you see? We're really

313
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:14,417
and truly and certifiably

314
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,083
the biggest of the bigshots

315
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,083
in school right now!

316
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,250
Huh?

317
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,000
They all think

318
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,000
we're the greatest

319
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,792
because we're their

320
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,792
ticket to get time with

321
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:26,166
Ponyville's newest and biggest

322
00:09:21,834 --> 00:09:26,166
celebrity: Princess Twilight.

323
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,125
We just said like two seconds

324
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:29,125
ago that inviting two ponies

325
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,625
to Twilight Time

326
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,625
was a big mistake!

327
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,208
<i>and now we're supposed to</i>

328
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,208
<i>bring the whole class?</i>

329
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,250
Relax.

330
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,291
I got this.

331
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:42,291
I don't like this,

332
00:09:39,834 --> 00:09:42,291
Sweetie Belle.

333
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,417
You said not to invite them

334
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,417
to Twilight Time and I didn't,

335
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,625
so what's the problem?

336
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:48,542
This feels like a trick.

337
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,041
What's tricky about inviting

338
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,041
Twilight out for a meal

339
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,875
thanking her for all the nice

340
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,875
things she's done for us?

341
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,500
Seems like the least

342
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,500
we can do for the Princess.

343
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,166
Did someone say Princess?

344
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,250
When I told you when you could

345
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:07,250
come eyeball the Princess

346
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:08,583
at one of her favorite hangouts,

347
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,834
I said only two or

348
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,834
three of you, tops.

00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:17,000
OK, but stay out of sight.

352
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,000
As you wish, Sweetie Belle.

353
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,667
Yes. As I wish.

how hungry I was.

help you develop new skills,

366
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,625
I thought: working with young

367
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,625
students so devoted to the joy

368
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,583
of learning purely

369
00:10:43,667 --> 00:10:45,583

370
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,083
What could be better?

371
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,667
You all remind me of

372
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:49,667
myself when I was your age.

Is this true?

580

We wanted our time together

581
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,959
just as a way to be with you

582
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,959
and learn new things.
