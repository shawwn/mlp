Just remember, you fellas

575
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,542
wouldn't be enjoyin' these pies

576
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:43,834
if it weren't for my sister.

577
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,917
And MY sister!

578
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,333
But this don't change the fact

579
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,333
that trying to make this

580
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:49,333
delivery on your own

581
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,208
was a plumb crazy

582
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:51,208
thing to do.

583
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,166
I know.

584
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:57,208
I bet Granny Smith grounds you

585
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:57,208
for a month for sneakin' out!

586
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,166
And if Big Mac, Granny Smith

587
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,166
and I ever have to be away

588
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,417
for the day again...

589
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:05,166
I would totally trust

590
00:21:02,959 --> 00:21:05,166
you to stay home

591
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,959
<i>and take care of</i>

592
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,959
<i>things on your own.</i>

593
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,166
I guess I did get a little

594
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,166
carried away watchin' over ya,

595
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,208
and if ya hadn't snuck

596
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,208
out like you did,

597
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,333
maybe I wouldn't have

598
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,333
figured that out.

599
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,458
Yes! Now<i> that</i> is the kind

600
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,458
of looking out for me

601
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,041
I can definitely appreciate!

602
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,834
So we're good?

603
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,667
Little sister,

604
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:26,667
we're always good.
