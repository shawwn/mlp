192
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:50,125
Stretchy but not clingy,

193
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:50,125
shimmery but not showy.

194
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,083
Sounds amazing.

195
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,709
There's nothing left for me to

196
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,709
do but check in at the runway

197
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,000
with my dresses by

198
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,000
two this afternoon.

199
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,750
That's funny, because

200
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,750
that clock over there

201
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,750
makes it seem like that's

202
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:00,750
only ten minutes from now.

203
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:02,125

204
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,166
<i>(rainfall)</i>

205
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:05,500
Oh, my ribbons and threads!

206
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,667
And the runway ballroom is

207
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,667
all the way across town.

208
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:12,208
If I don't get there,

209
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:12,208
I'm disqualified! Taxi!

210
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,709
Oh no! We've got to help

211
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,709
her find a cab now!

212
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,250
I'm on it.

213
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,375
Hey buddy, is this cab taken?

214
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,041
The line ends

215
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,041
back there, buddy!

216
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,834
Huh? What?

217
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,375
Does everypony in

218
00:06:23,875 --> 00:06:26,375
this town want a cab?

219
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm afraid getting a

220
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,000
taxi at this time

221
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,166
could prove almost

222
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,166
impossible.

223
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,125
Please, won't you let

224
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:32,125
her have this taxi?

225
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,875
She has somewhere very

226
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,875
important to be right away.

227
00:06:34,917 --> 00:06:36,125
Not likely!

228
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,250
She can get in line

229
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,250
like the rest of us!

230
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:42,458
<i>(angry shouts)</i>

231
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,750
Oh, it's no use.

232
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,542
The cab drivers just

233
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:45,542
drive right past

234
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,291
to get to the next

235
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,291
pony in line.

236
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,625
New wheel works

237
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,625
like a charm.

238
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,375
So now which of you nice

239
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,375
folks are hoppin' in?

240
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,625
Fashion Runway Plaza

241
00:06:54,417 --> 00:06:56,625
in seven minutes.

242
00:06:56,667 --> 00:06:57,625
Can you make it?

243
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,625
Hang on!

244
00:06:58,667 --> 00:06:59,834
Ta ta!

245
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:01,417
Phew! That was close.

246
00:07:01,458 --> 00:07:02,709
<i>(agreement)</i>

247
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,917
Anypony else got a

248
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,917
sneaking suspicion

249
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,083
we're forgetting something?

250
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,458
The dresses!!

251
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,083
♪♪

252
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,125
Good afternoon. I'm

253
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:16,125
here for Fashion Week.

254
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,917
Everypony's gathered in front of

255
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,917
the runway and about to start.

256
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,333
So you'll just have to bring

257
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,333
your dresses along with you

258
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,542
and store them

259
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,542
backstage later.

260
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,667
My dresses? How could I

261
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:27,667
possibly forget them?

262
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,542
Ah! Ah! Ah!

263
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,834
I'm doomed!

264
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,250
Got 'em right

265
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,250
here, ma'am.

266
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,041
Your friends told me you

267
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:35,041
need these in a hurry

268
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,667
so I offered to race

269
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:36,667
them over myself.

270
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,458
"Anything for that

271
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:38,458
nice mare" I told 'em.

272
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,792
<i>You're a life saver!</i>

273
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,125
Whew! I made it!

274
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:46,083
And with seconds to spare.

275
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,208
Hello, everypony!

276
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,875
Pleased to meet you all.

277
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:50,208
Rarity, I presume?

278
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:56,834
You must be Prim Hemline,

279
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:56,834
the host of this grand event.

280
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,166
How do you--

281
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,041
Miss Rarity, how is it

282
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,041
that all your competitors

283
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,750
are here half an hour early,

284
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,875
and yet you arrive

285
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:04,875
seconds before we begin?

286
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:09,709
Oh, um, heh heh.

287
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:09,709
Just lucky I guess.

288
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,875
Once we're done here, you're

289
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,875
to finish setting up backstage,

290
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,917
so you'll be ready for your

291
00:08:12,917 --> 00:08:15,917
run-through appointment.

292
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,792
You'll show your

293
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,792
designs last.

294
00:08:17,834 --> 00:08:19,583
We keep to a precise schedule

295
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,041
so let's try to be more than

296
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:23,041
a few seconds early, hmm?

297
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,125
Tomorrow is the contest

298
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:25,125
to see which one of you

299
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:29,041
gets to stay to meet top

300
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:29,041
designers all across the city.

301
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,542
The rest of you

302
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,542
must go home early.

303
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:32,583
So sad.

304
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,250
Dismissed.

305
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,291
I'm so glad you

306
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:39,291
made it, Rarity.

307
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,875
Me too, but everything just

308
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:42,875
seems to keep working out.

309
00:08:42,917 --> 00:08:44,709
Don't you remember me?

310
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,959
Suri Polomare, from the

311
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:47,959
Ponyville Knitter's League?

312
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,417
Oh! Yes of course, of course!

313
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,375
I thought you looked familiar

314
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:53,375
but I couldn't place it.

315
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:55,166
You haven't been

316
00:08:53,417 --> 00:08:55,166
back in years.

317
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:59,417
Because I moved here to make it

318
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:59,417
in the big city. (laugh) OK?

319
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh! Good for you, Suri!

320
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:04,458
It's so good to see you.

321
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,250
And now here we are...

322
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:08,625
Competing. (laugh) OK.

323
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:09,709
Yes, yes.

324
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,917
Well, good luck.

325
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,208
Oh, I don't need luck.

326
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,959
Would you like a hoof

327
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,959
with your things?

328
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,792
Why thank you so much.

329
00:09:17,417 --> 00:09:19,875
My, your collection is gorgeous!

330
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:23,083
Oh now, I'm sure your

331
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:23,083
collection is equally lovely

332
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,709
if not more so.

333
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,166
It's all right, but

334
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,166
nothing like this!

335
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,750
Take my culottes, for example.

336
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:31,000
They are simply crying out

337
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:31,000
for just the right accent

338
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,417
but I haven't the

339
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:32,417
slightest notion where--

340
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,000
<i>(gasp)</i>

341
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,792
Actually, just a touch of this

342
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,792
fabric could be perfect with it.

343
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:41,000
Hey, would you mind terribly

344
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:41,000
if I took a swatch?

345
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,208
Oh, not at all.

346
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,208
Here, I have loads extra.

347
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,750
You're sure?

348
00:09:45,792 --> 00:09:47,000
Positive.

349
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,750
Well, it's been wonderful

350
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,750
getting caught up

351
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,291
and I don't wish to be rude,

352
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,041
but I need to finish

353
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,041
my preparations

354
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,458
and I am a bit late

355
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:54,458
as it... is?

356
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:00,125
Hello, I'm here

357
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:00,125
half an hour early

358
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,375
for my run-through appointment,

359
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,375
just the way Prim likes.

360
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,792
Get in line over there.

361
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:10,000
Oh my, that fabric's gorgeous.

362
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,709
Did you make that yourself?

363
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,250
Why yes, it's...

364
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,250
stretchy but not clingy.

365
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,458
<i>Suri: Shimmery but not showy.</i>

366
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,041
<i>And the entire line is in</i>

367
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,041
<i>this same adorable pattern</i>

368
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,125
<i>that works on everything from</i>

369
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,125
<i>skirts to tops to shoes.</i>

370
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,500
<i>(chuckle)</i>

371
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,291
Bravo! I've never seen

372
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:27,291
anything like it.

373
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,125
You stole my fabric!

374
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,208
(laugh) I didn't

375
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:35,208
steal it, OK?

376
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,208
You gave it to me, remember?

377
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,375
I gave you the

378
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,375
fabric for accents,

379
00:10:39,417 --> 00:10:41,208
not for your whole line!

380
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,041
And how could you possibly

381
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,041
make all those outfits

382

574
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,333
<i>(desk bell rings)</i>

575
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,750
I need a moment

576
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,750
with Prim Hemline.

577
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,166
I have to rush

578
00:17:19,792 --> 00:17:21,166
back to Ponyville

579
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,000
but I just wanted to

580
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,000
thank her first for--

581
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,041
Uh oh oh. You best steer

582
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:26,041
clear of Prim for a while.

583
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,583
She's pretty furious.

584
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,583
Isn't that right?

585
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,250
Um...yes.

586
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,041
There you all are!

587
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,542
I can't believe it! I

588
00:17:35,083 --> 00:17:37,542
thought you went back home.

589
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,250
We missed the show

590
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,250
because we overslept.

591
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,333
Suri told us you lost;

592
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:43,333
we're really sorry.

593
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,041
I lost?

594
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,291
You know what? I

595
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,291
don't even care.

596
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,542
I'm just happy you're all still

597
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:52,542
here after how I treated you.

598
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,959
Taking advantage of your

599
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,959
friendship the way I did.

600
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,458
<i>How could you</i>

601
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,458
<i>ever see past it?</i>

602
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,667
Yeah, you were

603
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,667
pretty rotten.

604
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,125
Wow, Applejack.

605
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,417
I know your thing is

606
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,417
honesty, but come on!

607
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,417
Last night we may not have

608
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,417
seen you at your best,

609
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:08,959
but we know you.

610
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,875
And we would never let

611
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,875
one thing like that

612
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,625
change how we

613
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:12,625
feel about you.

614
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,542
Oh! Thank you.

615
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,583
You really are the most

616
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,583
wonderful friends

617
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:19,083
a pony could have.

618
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,041
You know, I already arranged

619
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,041
to make it up to you

620
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,500
this afternoon.

621
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:27,083
Hope you're all available

622
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:27,083
for an exclusive performance

623
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:28,917
of Hinny Of The Hills.

624
00:18:28,959 --> 00:18:32,208
<i>(cheers)</i>

625
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:35,417
And that is how it's done.

626
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,709
Pretty clever how I convinced

627
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:37,709
her to stay away from Prim,

628
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,375
wasn't it?

629
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:42,375
Wouldn't have wanted her to find

630
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:42,375
out the truth, now would we?

631
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:52,458
<i>♪ And I'm a dancing pony! ♪</i>

632
00:18:56,417 --> 00:19:02,333
<i>(cheers)</i>

633
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,417
Wow, that was even

634
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05,417
better than I imagined!

635
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,083
I LOVED IT!

636
00:19:10,834 --> 00:19:13,542
Uh, I mean, it was all right.

637
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:16,125
<i>(giggle)</i>

638
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,750
How did you ever get them to

639
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:18,750
agree to do an extra performance

640
00:19:18,792 --> 00:19:20,208
just for us?

641
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,792
Remember my costume designer

642
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:22,792
friend who got me the tickets?

643
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:26,709
Well, I offered to make all

644
00:19:22,834 --> 00:19:26,709
the costumes for his next show.

645
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,500
Here in Manehattan?

646
00:19:29,542 --> 00:19:32,166
Well, um... yes.

647
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,792
It will keep me away from

648
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,792
Ponyville for a while...

649
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:35,875
<i>(sigh)</i>

650
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,917
But I so wanted

651
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:37,917
you to see this show!

652
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:41,125
And working for this designer

653
00:19:37,959 --> 00:19:41,125
is such a great opportunity.

654
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,250
We know.

655
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:44,041
We're happy for you, Rarity.

656
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,417
We're just sad for us.

657
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,792
<i>Mind if I join you?</i>

658
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,959
Sure. Come on down.

659
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,000
This is the First Place

660
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,000
Trophy for Fashion Week.

661
00:20:00,041 --> 00:20:01,166
With my name on it.

662
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:02,500
But I thought I lost!

663
00:20:02,542 --> 00:20:04,166
You didn't. You won.

664
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:08,583
Suri was hoping that if you

665
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:08,583
didn't claim your prize,

666
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,250
the judges would

667
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:10,250
consider it a forfeit

668
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,542
and first place

669
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,542
would go to her.

670
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:16,750
So she lied to make you and

671
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:16,750
your friends go away, and...

672
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:19,458
well, I lied, too.

673
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,333
I've worked for

674
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,333
Suri for so long,

675
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,959
I started to believe

676
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,959
that it really is

677
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,542
every pony for

678
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,542
herself in this town.

679
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,458
Until I saw how generous

680
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,458
you were with your friends.

681
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,834
And how generous

682
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,834
they were with you.

683
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,834
It made me start believing

684
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,291
there was something

685
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,291
better for me out there.

686
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:36,875
So I, I quit.

687
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:41,083
I brought you something

688
00:20:38,834 --> 00:20:41,083
to say thank you.

689
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,458
I suppose you'll need a job now

690
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,458
that you're no longer with Suri.

691
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,291
How would you like to

692
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,291
work for my friend

693
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,291
making all the costumes

694
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,291
for his next show?

695
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,709
Manehattan was simply grand.
