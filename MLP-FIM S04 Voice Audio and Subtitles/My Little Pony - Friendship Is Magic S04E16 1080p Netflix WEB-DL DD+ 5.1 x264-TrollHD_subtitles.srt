86
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:32,166
why they need the Pegasi

87
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:33,917
to make a breeze for them.

88
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,041
Well, you see,

89
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:36,041
it's the breeze

90
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,333
that activates the

91
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,333
Breezie's magic.

92
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,709
And that magic protects the

93
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,709
pollen they're carrying

94
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,458
from being destroyed.

95
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,834
So no breeze means no magic

96
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,834
means the pollen goes bad?

97
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,208
That's right.

98
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,625
And they only have two days

99
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,625
to get that pollen back

100
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,375

102
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,333

103
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,333
ever so important

104
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:58,542

I'm just so very happy they

574
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,208
got to be reunited

575
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:16,959

580
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,875
Goodbye, Breezies.

581
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,875
I must go now.

582
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,625
To remember us by.

583
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:39,458
Thank you.

584
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,458
I'll miss you.

585
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:43,000
I'll miss all of you.

wondered what it would be like

to be a Gryphon.

603
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:21,750
Not a chance.

604
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,834
You sure? What about a

dragon? No?
