EXCITED?! EXCITED?!

525
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:19,659
WHY WOULD I BE EXCITED TO ATTEND
MY OWN FAREWELL PARTY?!

526
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,628
FAREWELL PARTY?

527

YES!

528
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,696
YOU DON'T LIKE ME ANYMORE,

529
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,665
SO YOU DECIDED TO KICK ME
OUT OF THE GROUP

530
00:19:25,698 --> 00:19:27,634
AND THROW A GREAT BIG PARTY
TO CELEBRATE,

531

A-FAREWELL-TO-PINKIE PIE
PARTY!

532
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,339
WHY IN THE WORLD
WOULD YOU THINK

533
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:34,307
WE DIDN'T LIKE YOU ANYMORE,
SUGAR CUBE?

534
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,342
WHY?

535
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:36,876
WHY?!

536
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,745
WHY?!
OH!

537
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:42,382
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME
AND AVOIDING ME ALL DAY!

538
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,284
THAT'S WHY!

539
00:19:44,317 --> 00:19:48,555
UH, YEAH, BECAUSE WE WANTED
YOUR PARTY TO BE A SURPRISE.

540
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:50,923
WE'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS PARTY
FOR SUCH A LONG TIME.

541
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,860
WE HAD TO MAKE EXCUSES FOR WHY
WE COULDN'T ATTEND GUMMY'S PARTY

542
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:56,296
SO THAT WE COULD GET
EVERYTHING READY FOR YOURS.

Twilight: IF THIS IS
A FAREWELL PARTY,

544
00:19:58,265 --> 00:20:00,533
WHY DOES THE CAKE I PICKED UP
FROM SUGAR CUBE CORNER

545
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,935

YOU DECIDED TO THROW ME
A SURPRISE PARTY!

00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,595
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING
TO TELL YOU, DARLING.

IT'S OKAY, PINKIE PIE.

558

560
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,574
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

561
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:44,711
I'M JUST GLAD I HAVEN'T BEEN
REPLACED BY A BUCKET OF TURNIPS.

562
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,979
HUH?
YOU DON'T WANT
TO KNOW.

563
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:49,382
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS.
ENOUGH OF THIS GABBIN'.

I AM WRITING TO YOU FROM
THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PARTY.

I AM NOT ONLY HAVING A GREAT
TIME WITH MY FRIENDS

BUT ALSO WAS GIVEN
THE OPPORTUNITY

572
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,603
TO LEARN A VALUABLE LESSON
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP.

573
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:12,805
ALWAYS EXPECT THE BEST
FROM YOUR FRIENDS
