[Twilight]<i> Princess Celestia,</i>

2
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,840
<i>I have an idea for</i>

00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,840
<i>your Onesversary!</i>

4
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:08,049
My... Onesversary?

5
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,678
The one thousand one hundred

6
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,678
eleventh year anniversary

7
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,262
of when you first

8
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,262
raised the sun.

9
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,055
Good thing Pinkie

10
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:14,055
Pie reminded us,

11
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,057
or we woulda forgot

12
00:00:14,097 --> 00:00:16,057
to celebrate!

13
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,935
You're not the only ones.

14
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:19,186
What did you have in mind?

15
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:23,022
To commemorate your first

16
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:23,022
sunrise, I've written a play.

17
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,066
We'd like to perform it at

18
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,066
my School of Friendship.

19
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,067
If you don't mind.

20
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:29,070
[excited laugh] Ooh!

21
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,071
Mind?

22
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,032
Oh, of course not!

23
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,953
Oh, I think a play

24
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,953
is a fantastic idea!

25
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:38,246
Did she just...

26
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:38,246
prance?

27
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,750
Oh. Forgive me for

28
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:41,750
getting so excited.

29
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,251
I-it's just...

30
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:47,088
When I was a filly, my

31
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:47,088
friends often put on plays.

32
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:51,092
Oh, it was so wonderful,

34

to create a magical experience

35
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:54,847
to share with others.

36
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:58,058
I've always believed theatre

37
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:58,058
brings out the best in us,

38
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,519
and forges a special

39
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,519
bond of friendship.

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:01,520
[gasp]

41
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,064
I didn't know you used to act.

42
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,691
Oh, not me.

43
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,985
I was always too busy

44
00:01:05,733 --> 00:01:07,985
with my magic lessons

45
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,111
to be part of any

46
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:10,111
plays myself.

47
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,741
But still, it's something

48
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,741
I always wished

49
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,116
I could experience.

50
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,911
And you still can!

star in your play?

78
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,209
Yeah, when did that

79
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:06,209

It's perfect!

84
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,843
Princess Celestia has always

85
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,843
wanted to be in a play,

86
00:02:14,885 --> 00:02:17,178
and this one's about her!

87
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,472
I guess...

88
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,265
But how are we supposed

89
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,265
to give her directions?

90
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:22,183
She's the ruler of Equestria!

91
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,978
She's also our friend.

00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,354
Celestia's always

00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:26,354
kind to everypony.

94
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,357
So if we have a chance to

95
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:29,357
finally do something for her,

96
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,609
we should!

97
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,193

Yes, Princess Celestia?

107
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,288
Your invitation

108
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,288
is very kind.

109
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,332
But are you certain

110
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,332
it's wise?

111
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:48,376

Please?

117
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,301
It'd mean so much

118
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:56,301
to the students

119
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,095

Yeah, what she said.

122
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,729
Then I would be delighted

129
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:19,324
to keep your special effects

130
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,409
away from my sets?

131
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,037
Three hundred twenty-seven.

Things looked bleak.

242
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:21,215
Soon, Equestria would

243

lose all its magic-users!

244
00:06:21,256 --> 00:06:25,969
