thought you'd be a hoot,

581
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,306
but I ain't never

582
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,306
met a wetter hen!

583
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,557
What?

584
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:03,059
She's right.

585
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,394
You've had your mane in a

586
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,394
twist ever since we arrived.

587
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:08,230

I'm so sorry, everypony!

590
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,820
The truth is, all I've wanted

591
00:19:10,984 --> 00:19:13,820
to do for this whole trip is

592
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:16,072
ride the Wild Blue Yonder!

593
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:19,533
I mean, it's why I came to

594
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:19,533
Las Pegasus in the first place!

595
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,578
Applejack told me not to

let you out of my sight,

597
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,289
or you might overdo it and

598
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,289
we'd have to go home early.

599
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,917
Applejack put

600
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:27,917
you up to this?

Shoulda known.
