00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,811
THAT'S what you've been standing

198
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,811
here all this time to say?

199
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:40,275
I was deciding between

200
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:40,275
"goodbye" and "see you later."

201
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,401
But...they're

202
00:06:40,317 --> 00:06:42,401
the same thing!

203
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,946
Technically?

204
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,946
They're very different.

205
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,158
"See you later" implies an

206
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:48,158
event in the near future

207
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,451
wherin we see each other.

208
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,454
"Goodbye" expresses good

209
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,454
wishes where parting

210
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,999
or at the end of

211
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,999
a conversation.

212
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,458
Yeah. Same thing.

213
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,501
[clang]

214
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,462
I will not apologize for

215
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,462
speaking with precision.

216
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,464
In that case,

217
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,464
apology not accepted!

218
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,465
Goodbye-later-seeya-same thing!

219
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,466
[slam]

220
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,468
Can you believe that guy?

221
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,888
Huh?

222
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,056
"Out to lunch?"

223
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:13,058
Oh, come on!

224
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,937
No Maud, no cake, no anything!

225
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,147
And how annoying was that pony?

226
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,481
Who takes that long

227
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,481
to say goodbye?

228
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,983
Or was it "see you later?"

229
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,027
Ugh, now he's got me doing it!

230
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,486
[thud]

231
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,155
Hello, Pinkie Pie.

232
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,323
Maud!

233
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:29,157
Found you!

234
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,284
My turn to hide!

235
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:31,534
[crash]

236
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,828
I'm sorry I wasn't

237
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,828
around this morning.

238
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,456
Oh, psh, what are you

239
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,456
apologizing to me for?

240
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,541
I'm not upset, you silly willy.

241
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,420
The reason is I

242
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,420
met somepony...

243
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,503
Want to hang

244
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,503
out right now?

245
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,423
I mean, I can see you're

246
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,423
not doing anything

247
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,257
with anypony else.

248
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,843
Unless they're invisible

249
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,843
or really small.

250
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,845
Pinkie.

251
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,640
The reason I've been so busy

252
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,640
is that I have a boyfriend now.

253
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:55,600
A wha?

254
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,394
A boyfriend.

255
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,520
A whaaaaaa?

256
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:01,064
A boyfriend.

257
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,400
A whaaaaaa?

258
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,567
A boyfriend.

259
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,361
That's so exciting!

260
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:07,528
MY sister!

261
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,530
In love!

262
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,326
Technically, we're

263
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,326
"in like."

264
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,119
Tell me everything!

265
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,245
[zoom]

266
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,537
Who is he? What's

267
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:16,537
his favorite color?

268
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,789
Does he like ice cream?

269
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,666
If he were a bird, what

270
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:19,666
kind of bird would he be?

271
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,751
Wait. Is he

272
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,751
actually a bird?

273
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,463
Oh! I don't know because you

274
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,463
haven't told me anything yet!

275
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,423
You'll like him.

276
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:28,549
We have a lot in common.

277
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,260
Well, I love you,

278
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,429
so I know I'm going to

279
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,429
love your boyfriend!

280
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,514
Oh! I can't wait

281
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,514
to meet him!

282
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:36,516
You don't have to.

283
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,311
[gasp]

284
00:08:39,353 --> 00:08:40,937
He's a rock!

285
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,065
And you love rocks,

286
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,065
so it's perfect.

287
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,276
Is Boulder jealous?

288
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,569
No, behind the rock.

289
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,572
Mudbriar, are you back there?

290
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,616
Technically?

291
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:53,616
Not anymore.

292
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,536
Wha wha whaaaaa?

293
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,128
Pinkie Pie,

294
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:05,128
meet Mudbriar.

295
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,254
Technically?

296
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,630
We've already met.

297
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,466
You...?

298
00:09:09,508 --> 00:09:10,384
Yes.

299
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,676
You?

300
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,593
Yes.

301
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,262
You.

302
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,306
Yes.

303
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,140
I mean...

304
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,517
haha, you!

305
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,977
You! You! You!

306
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,688
Yes. Yes. Yes.

307
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,441
I'm sorry, let's

308
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,441
start over.

309
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,277
Hi! I'm Maud's

310
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,277
sister, Pinkie Pie.

311
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,987
I know.

312
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:33,865
So...

313
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,616
How did...

314
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,994
You two meet?

315
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,163
At a rock show.

316
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,082
Oh, you're into

317
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,082
rocks too?

318
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,210
No. I like sticks.

319
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,712
Then why were you

320
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,712
at a rock show?

321
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,341
It was a petrified wood show,

322
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:51,341
which technically

323
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:53,176
makes it a stick show.

324
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,636
Except that in the

325
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,636
permineralization process

326
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,099
of petrification, all organic

327
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,099
material is replaced with

328
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,018
silicates, i.e. rocks...

329
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,688
...while retaining the original

330
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:05,688
structural elements of wood.

331
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,691
Q.E.D. It was a stick show.

332
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,652
I'm... really

333
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,652
into sticks too!

334
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,863
They're great for

335
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,863
hitting piñatas!

336
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,615
Aaahhh!

337
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,452
Pinkie!

338
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,537
Oh, you

339
00:10:18,493 --> 00:10:20,537
wanna go first?

340
00:10:20,579 --> 00:10:22,539
That is stick abuse.

341
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,457
It is?

342
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,126
I'm sorry.

343
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,670
Oh, this is awful, I am not

344
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,670
being a very good sister.

345
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,671
Let's start over.

346
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,966
I'm Pinkie Pie,

347
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,966
nice to meet you.

348
00:10:33,258 --> 00:10:34,634
Technically?

349
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,261
We've already met.

350
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,389
You should introduce

351
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,389
Pinkie to your pet.

352
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,224
Oh!

353
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,683
Your pet likes fetch!

354
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,685
This<i> is</i> my pet.

355
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,187
So no.

356
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,692
Aw. Look at Twiggy and

357
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,692
Boulder playing together.

358
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,321
They're adorable.

359
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:56,697
It's just a stick.

360
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,158
Don't be rude.

361
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,701
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

362
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,454
One more time...

363
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,706
I'm Pinkie Pie,

364
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,706
nice to meet you.

365
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:06,707
Technically...

366
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,543
We've already met.

367
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,170
[growl]

368
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,800
[flowing water]

369
00:11:15,842 --> 00:11:16,717
Ahhhh!

370
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,011
I don't get this guy!

371
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,722
Wow! Maud has a boyfriend?

372
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:22,807
Agh!

373
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,601
How can she like

374
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,601
someone so weird?

375
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,648
He has an inanimate

376
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,648
object for a pet!

377
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,358
So does Maud.

378
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,527
Boulder has ten times

379
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,527
the personality

380
00:11:33,568 --> 00:11:35,320
of some random stick.

381
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:37,738
Mudbriar too, for that matter.

382
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,574
He's not like Maud at all.

383
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,702
Maud is hilarious, friendly,

384
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,702
caring, and easy to talk to!

385
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,704
Yup, that's Maud.

386
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,750
But this guy is awkward,

387
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,750
quiet, and kind of...

388
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,503
strange!

389
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,754
Uh, that also

390
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:53,754
