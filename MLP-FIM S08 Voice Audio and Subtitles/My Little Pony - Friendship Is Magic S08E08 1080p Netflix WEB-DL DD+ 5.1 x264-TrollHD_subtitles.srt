Dad?

585
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,248
Hello, Ms. Glimmer.

586
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,250
How is your friendship

587
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:04,250
problem search going?

588
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,753
I only ask as an

589
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,753
interested observer,

590
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,922
since I know you are an

591
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,922
adult who's capable

592
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,591
of doing things without

593
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:11,591
help from any pony else.

594
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:17,513
Actually, I think Sunburst

595
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:17,513
and I figured out what it is.

596
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,768
So, Stellar and I weren't

597
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,768
really helpful after all.

598
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,145
Well, we haven't

599
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,145
actually solved it.

600
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,147
And I don't think we can.

601
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,148
Not without you.

602
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,154

Pungent!

605
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,246
Oh, did you come by

606
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,246
to be driven crazy

607
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:44,874
by more of your mother's plans?

608
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,210
No, I came to apologize.

609
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,171
Well, it's going to take

610
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:51,171
more than an apology

611
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,800
to make up for telling me

612
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:53,800
you don't want my help

613
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,635
finding your

614
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,635
friendship problem.

615
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,386
Oh, I'm not sorry for that.

616
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,680
Starlight and I already figured

617
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:59,680
out what the problem is.

618
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,141
This is a terrible apology.

619
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,979
Well, if you come with

620
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,979
me and help fix it,

621
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,146
I'll give you a better one.

622
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,152
Usually, Twilight or one of

623
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,152
our other friends gets called

624
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,947
to a place with a

625
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,947
friendship problem to fix.

626
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,198
But Starlight and I

627
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:18,198
realized we came here

628
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,201
to fix a friendship

629
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,201
problem we already had.

630
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,122
I'm sorry I've been

631
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,122
avoiding coming home, Dad,

632
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,166
but you can't keep

633
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,166
treating me like a foal.

634
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,836
I'm sorry, Sugarbun!

[chuckle]

636
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,883
I just know how hard things

637
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,883
were for you when you left home.

638
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:41,097
I guess I wanted you to feel

639
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:41,097
safe, like when you were young.

640
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,141
Dad, I know I've

641
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,141
made some mistakes,

642
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,225
and I'll probably

643
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,225
make a bunch more,

644
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,103
but I learn from them.

645
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,022
I think that's

646
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:49,022
what growing up is.

647
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,986
I'm sorry I never told you how

648
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,986
much your plans bothered me,

649
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,237
and I know you just

650
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,237
want me to succeed,

651
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,198
but I need to do

652
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,198
that on my own.

653
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,241
I remember how

654
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,241
lost you were

655
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,203
when you flunked out

656
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,203
of magic school.

657
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,246
I thought as long

658
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,246
as you had a plan,

659
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,708
you'd never feel

660
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,708
that way again.

661
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,126
You don't have to worry, Mom.

662
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,170
I need to find my own way,

663
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,338
but I definitely don't

664
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,338
feel lost anymore.

The glowing cutie mark is such

there's a way for you

Heh heh. Pretty sure it

674
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,282
doesn't work that way.

675

Not unless we solved a

friendship problem every few

677

678

one will be it for a while.

your friends too.

683
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,382
I guess so.

684
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,802
So, if I promise to treat you

685
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,802
less like a little filly

686
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,430

687
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,430

drive me crazy again,

691
