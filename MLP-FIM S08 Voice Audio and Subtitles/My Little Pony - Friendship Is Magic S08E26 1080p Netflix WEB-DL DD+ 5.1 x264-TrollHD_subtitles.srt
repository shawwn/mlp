195
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,541
I know he doesn't

196
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,541
like non-ponies,

197
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,211
but if we tell him what's

198
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,211
going on, he'll help.

199
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,383
I'm sure you're all concerned

200
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:42,383
about the magic situation,

201
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,263
but I want to assure you that

202
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:46,263
this institution is safe,

203
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,473
despite the absence

204
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,473
of your Headmare.

205
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,144
As your new Headstallion, let

206
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,144
me be the first to say

207
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,772
that the reign of Princess

208
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,772
Twilight is over.

209
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:59,400
From now on, this school will

210
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:59,400
adhere to EEA doctrine

211
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,237
as it should have

212
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,237
from the start.

213
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:06,616
[alarmed murmurs]

214
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,410
Thank you, Chancellor Neighsay,

215
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,410
for that rousing speech.

216
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:15,625
I know you're a stallion who

217
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:15,625
truly believes what you say.

218
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,418
And when you say this

219
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,418
school will be run

220
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,172
according to EEA doctrine,

221
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:20,172
I know you mean it.

222
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,799
And when you say there won't

223
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,799
be any more lessons

224
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,011
from the Princess of Friendship

225
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:26,011
at the School of Friendship,

226
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,428
I guess you mean that too.

227
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,557
That's not exact--

228
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,434
But Twilight decided

229
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,434
to run her school

230
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,562
outside of the EEA guidelines.

231
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,731
And even though you

232
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,731
tried to stop her,

233
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,441
Princesses Celestia and

234
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,441
Luna trusted her enough

235
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,028
to support her.

236
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,321
Well, I wouldn't say--

237
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,324
So since I know you

238
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:47,324
mean what you say,

239
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,327
my question is really

240
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,327
for the students.

241
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,163
Are we going to give the pony

242
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:53,163
who already tried to wreck

243
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:57,000
Twilight's school once

244
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:57,000
another chance to do it?

245
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,001
No!

246
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,253
No way!

247
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:00,587
Not gonna happen!

248
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,924
I guess things will have to stay

249
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:03,924
the way Twilight wants them,

250
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,634
which includes

251
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,634
leaving me in charge.

252
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,427
Yeah!

253
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,272
OK, so maybe we need a new plan.

254
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,902
[dramatic music]

255
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:25,612
Oh, oh, not too tight.

256
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,155
We don't want to

257
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,155
hurt the Chancellor.

258
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,951
I'm sure Twilight will

259
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,951
know what to do with him

260
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,869
when she gets back.

261
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,495
Now, back to class everyone.

262
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,540
We've let the EEA disrupt our

263
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,540
friendship studies long enough.

264
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,336
[grunt]

265
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:43,922
Why are you doing this?

266
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,506
I thought you wanted

267
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,506
to have somepony

268
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,342
in charge of the school.

269
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,637
Oh, I do! You just aren't

270
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,637
the pony I had in mind.

271
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,393
I can't very well have the

272
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:56,393
EEA running the school

273
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:58,270
if I want to run it myself.

274
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,022
Of course, that's

275
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,022
just the beginning.

276
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,650
You see, if there's one

277
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,650
thing I've learned here,

278
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:08,196
it's that friendship is the

279
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:08,196
most powerful thing there is,

280
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,116
and as Headmare of the

281
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,116
School of Friendship,

282
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,162
nopony will have more

283
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:15,162
friends than me!

284
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:19,874
Making me the most

285
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:19,874
powerful pony in Equestria!

286
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,544
[evil laugh]

287
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,546
[gulp]

288
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,548
[soft giggling]

289
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,549
Hey, Cozy Glow.

290
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,550
What's so funny?

291
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,179
Are you just happy to

292
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,179
be running the school?

293
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,182
Oh, I'm just keeping

294
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,182
Twilight's seat warm.

295
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,851
Still, it's pretty impressive!

296
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,560
Is there anything

297
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,560
we can do to help?

298
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,023
We can hang out with

299
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,023
you all day if you want.

300
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,734
You know, there is

301
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,734
something I need help with.

302
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,111
Yay! Whoo-hoo! Awesome!

303
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,957
Oh. Wonderful.

304
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,543
I suppose you've

305
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,543
all come to gloat.

306
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:08,006
Actually, we've come to undo

307
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:08,006
all these chains and free you!

308
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:10,008
But why?

309
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,387
Now that nasty pony

310
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,387
met even nastier pony,

311
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,306
maybe nasty pony

312
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:16,306
not be so nasty.

313
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,728
[crash]

314
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,563
Also we'd kinda

315
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,563
like to stop Cozy

316
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,607
before she drains all the

317
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,607
magic from Equestria.

318
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,194
She's behind that as well?

319
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,238
I must get word to

320
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,238
Celestia and Luna.

321
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,616
How? Without magic, it'll

322
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:35,616
take forever to get to them.

323
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,412
While it's true that unicorns

324
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,412
have lost their ability

325
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,498
to cast spells, the most

326
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:41,498
potent magic in Equestria

327
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,584
is housed in our... artifacts!

328
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,090
The EEA medallion allows me to

329
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,090
travel throughout Equestria.

330
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,300
Its magic worked when

331
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,300
I chained you up,

332
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,345
perhaps it still has enough

333
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:55,345
to send me to the Princesses.

334
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:01,142
[zap]

335
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,441
I hope he makes it.

336
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,650
I hope he doesn't come

337
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,650
back and lock us up again.

338
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,361
If he comes back.

339
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,654
Everything's

340
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,654
gonna be fine!

341
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,616
Twilight and the others are

342
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,616
probably already on their way.

343
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,084
Are you sure there's

344
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,084
magic in Cerberus?

345
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,002
Clarissa the pig has two tails,

346
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,754
and while her singing

347
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,754
voice is lovely,

348
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,756
I don't think

349
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,756
it's magical.

350
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,426
We need to try everything if

351
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:34,426
we want to get out of here.

352
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,137
I don't know,

353
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:37,137
Tartarus isn't so bad.

354
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,681
I could hang out

355
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,681
here for a while.

356
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,933
[whoosh]

357
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,268
[crunch]

358
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,770
Maybe not

359
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,770
forever, though.

360
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,689
But that is just

361
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,689
what it will be.

362
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:53,694
If my protege has followed my

363
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:53,694
instructions, by sunset tonight,

364
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,864
every last vestige

365
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:56,864
of Equestrian magic

366
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,701
will disappear into

367
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,701
the ether forever!

368
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,704
Have you even thought about

369
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:03,704
what losing magic would mean?

370
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,708
It means the six of you will be

371
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:07,708
trapped here, like me.

372
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,628
[Spike] Seven!

373
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,670
Exactly.

374
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,712
It means you're trapped here.

375
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,507
Forever. With us.

376
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,219
I hadn't thought

377
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:18,219
of it like that.

378
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,806
So what do we do, Twilight?

379
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,809
Dash and Applejack nearly

380
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,809
have Cerberus tired out.

381
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,728
If Rarity pitches in, I think

382
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,728
they can get him to sit still

383
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,441
long enough to try

384
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,441
what I have in mind.

385
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,985
I'm sure I can get the

386
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,985
