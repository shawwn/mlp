00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,110
and return the magic

584
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,110
you stole,

585
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,154
you will stay here while I

586
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,154
summon your guardians

587
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,114
to take you home.

588
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:56,116
Wait!

589
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,786
You were right about them from

590
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,786
the beginning, Chancellor.

591
00:17:58,828 --> 00:18:00,120
I see that now.

592
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,539
What are you saying?

593
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,539
Sandbar?

594
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,499
I don't want anything

595
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,499
to do with creatures

596
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,292
that could threaten Equestria!

597
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,128
Wisely put, colt.

598
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,006
[zap]

599
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:14,844
Everypony will come to

600
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:14,844
their senses, eventually.

601
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,097
[door closes]

602
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,559
[knock]

603
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:24,020
[knock]

604
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,688
[knock]

605
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:28,024
[yawn]

606
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,570
What in tarnation?

607
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,614
Sorry. I ran

608
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,614
out of apples.

609
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:38,492
I need the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

610
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,994
My friends are in trouble.

611
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,996
Chancellor Neighsay

612
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,996
locked them up!

613
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,665
Huh? I thought Cozy

614
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:44,665
Glow was in charge.

615
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,208
Not anymore.

616
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,961
But you guys are good buddies.

617
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,754
If you can convince her

618
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,754
to distract Neighsay,

619
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,297
I can break out my friends.

620
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:52,882
Will you help me?

621
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,842
Do mulberries

622
00:18:52,924 --> 00:18:54,842
have seeds?

623
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:57,261
That's a yes.

624
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,933
Where's Equestria's

625
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,933
magic going, Tirek?

626
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,184
What's making it disappear?

627
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:09,189
If you let me out, I'm sure

628
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:09,189
it would jog my memory.

629
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,861
What do you say? I scratch

630
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:13,861
your back, you scratch mine?

631
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,196
How 'bout you tell

632
00:19:13,903 --> 00:19:16,196
us what you know,

633
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,032
or you'll be stuck

634
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,032
here forever,

635
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,911
because we're out of magic keys

636
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,911
and nopony can open the door?

637
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,955
Oh, dear. I hadn't

638
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,955
thought of that.

639
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,666
We're just as

640
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,666
trapped as Tirek?

641
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:28,668
Ha ha ha ha ha.

642
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,252
What a pity.

643
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,963
Well, for you.

644
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,173
Sweet revenge for me.

645
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,179
It seems my little protegee's

646
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:40,179
plan worked after all.

647
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,305
[all gasp]

648
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,223
Which little protegee?

649
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:45,225
Oh, we've never met.

650
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,268
We're pen pals.

651
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:51,231
Each letter had so many

652
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:51,231
questions about draining magic.

653
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,233
And you answered them?

654
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,944
Well, I was bored.

655
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,614
So I simply pointed my pen

656
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:58,614
pal in the right direction.

657
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,282
[thud]

658
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,243
Can't you just tell us

659
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,243
your pen pal's name?

660
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,789
I mean, since we're

661
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,789
stuck here anyway.

662
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,083
Oh, why not.

663
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,211
The irony is too perfect.

664
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,714
Her name is...

665
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,799
Cozy Glow!

666
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,801
I could've sworn I saw

667
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:18,801
her come down this way

668
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,678
when she left her office.

669
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,349
[gasp]

670
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,190
Enjoying yourself

671
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:32,190
in there, Starlight?

672
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:36,485
I'm sorry I had to push you

673
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:36,485
in, but what else could I do?

674
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:41,281
You were going to

675
00:20:36,527 --> 00:20:41,281
ruin all my plans.

676
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,825
[gasp]

677
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,368
You might get some company soon,

678
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,247
if I can't make that

679
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:48,247
annoying Neighsay BACK OFF.

680
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,336
All this magic needs time to

681
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:54,336
drain from Equestria

682
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,506
before my vortex sucks

683
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,506
it to another realm.

684
00:20:57,548 --> 00:20:59,050
[giggle]

685
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,886
Three days can sure

686
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,886
seem like forever, huh?

687
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:05,305
You know, you ponies

688
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:05,305
got it all wrong.

689
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,307
Friendship isn't magic.

690
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,268
Friendship is POWER!

691
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,065
With Twilight and her

692
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,065
lackies out of my way,

693
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:18,152
all of Equestria

694
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:18,152
will bow to me...

695
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,948
The future empress

696
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:21,948
of friendship!

697
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:27,078
[evil laugh building to

698
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:27,078
shrieking laughter]
