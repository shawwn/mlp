386
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:51,901
literally no room at the inns,

387
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,779
I guess it's lucky

388
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,779
we've got the wagon.

389
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,491
Sleeping In Tight

390
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,491
Quarters Bonding.

391
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:59,909
Yaaaay.

392
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:06,291
[grunts]

393
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,917
Is there something I can do

394
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,421
to make things more

395
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,421
comfortable for you?

396
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,423
You could get rid of this junk.

397
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,846
Yes, well, before we throw away

398
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:19,846
the magical items it's taken me

399
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,600
years to collect, we could

400
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:23,600
try switching hammocks.

401
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:24,976
Fine!

402
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:25,810
[clunk]

403
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,103
[flapping wings]

404
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:36,321
[loud snoring]

405
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,489
Starlight?

406
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:38,657
Starlight!

407
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,408
I think there's a

408
00:11:38,697 --> 00:11:40,408
wild animal outside.

409
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,660
[loud snore]

410
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,994
[crash]

411
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,037
Starlight?

412
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,247
[snore]

413
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,207
Starlight!

414
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,749
Wha...?

415
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,668
What?

416
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:50,751
I'm sorry.

417
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,879
Your snoring is a bit...

418
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,422
Loud? Heh heh.

419
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,007
Yeah. I do that.

420
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,842
I had my village convinced

421
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,842
we were being attacked

422
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,177
by bears every night.

423
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,683
But we probably need a

424
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,683
better solution here.

425
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,231
Ladies and gentleponies!

426
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:16,735
The Great and Powerful

427
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:16,735
Trixie will now...

428
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,321
Seriously?

429
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,906
Prepare to be amazed!

430
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:27,414
Sleep well?

431
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,873
Sure did.

432
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,796
Is uh, that the last

433
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,796
of the hay cakes?

434
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:38,174
Oh. yeah. Sorry.

435
00:12:38,216 --> 00:12:39,175
It's fine.

436
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,470
I don't suppose

437
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:42,470
there's more juice?

438
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,016
[glug glug] Ah!

439
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,019
I guess we'll have

440
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,019
to re-supply.

441
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:53,064
What a glorious morning!

442
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,612
I can't tell you how much

443
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,612
I am looking forward

444
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,280
to the first show

445
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,280
of your tour.

446
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,660
Is he going to be following

447
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,660
us for the whole time?

448
00:13:05,702 --> 00:13:07,537
I do not know.

449
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,414
[crowd murmuring]

450
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:12,250
She's been in there a long time.

451
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,629
Do you suppose the Terrifying

452
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:15,629
Trunk Escape is too much for a

453
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,966
pony who drinks all the juice

454
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,966
and talks nonstop in her sleep?

455
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,677
What if the Great and Powerful

456
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,677
Trixie can't--

457
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,178
[explosion]

458
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,308
Sleep because her roommate

459
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,308
snores like an Ursa Major?

460
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,559
[crowd chatters]

461
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,437
But if you're there,

462
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:32,437
who's in here?

463
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,938
[explosion]

464
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,153
There's not much

465
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,153
room in here.

466
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,739
At least you don't have to

467
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:42,739
sleep in it with another pony.

468
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,245
This show was much

469
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:49,245
better in Ponyville.

470
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,668
Oh! Would you like

471
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,668
the last carrot?

472
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,505
I know how fond you are of

473
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:58,505
eating the last of things.

474
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,341
Oh, no. It might

475
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,341
make me thirsty

476
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,260
and we don't have

477
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,260
anything to drink, so...

478
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,184
The good news is I'm so

479
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:11,184
exhausted I could sleep

480
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,020
through a stampede

481
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:14,020
of wild boars,

482
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,730
which you'll be

483
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,730
delighted to know

484
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,483
is only slightly louder

485
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,483
than your snoring.

486
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,819
Well,<i> I'm</i> looking forward

487
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,819
to rehearsing the act

488
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,403
with you all night.

489
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:27,450
So diligent of you to go over

490
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:27,450
it and over it in your sleep.

491
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,327
Practice makes perfect.

492
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,037
Not today, it didn't.

493
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,457
Well, I'm sorry

494
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,457
you're so miserable!

495
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,669
Really? Because if you wanted to

496
00:14:34,499 --> 00:14:37,669
make things more comfortable,

497
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,587
you could always

498
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:39,587
pare down a bit!

499
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,173
[clatter]

500
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,552
Well, since you're so

501
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,552
concerned about space,

502
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,345
you can have it all!

503
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,097
I'll sleep under the stars where

504
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,097
at least the wild animals

505
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,392
will be quieter than you!

506
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,149
I do not mean to interrupt, but

507
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,149
it seems there is trouble

508
00:15:00,191 --> 00:15:01,901
on the road to friendship.

509
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,696
Ha ha ha ha. Ya think?

510
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,580
Where's my wagon?

511
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,625
I traded it to that pony

512
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,625
from Saddle Arabia for his!

513
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,420
He even threw in

514
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:20,420
a pair of robes!

515
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:21,462
[horror sting]

516
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:27,176
YOU WHAT?

517
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:31,347
I traded the old, worn-out wagon

518
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:31,347
that was too small for us

519
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,475
for this nice, new, spacious

520
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:34,475
one that we can both enjoy.

521
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:38,479
But (spluttering] who said

522
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:38,479
you could do that?

523
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,189
Nopony. I just did it.

524
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,984
Now we both have

525
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,984
plenty of room

526
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,153
and you didn't even have

527
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,153
to give anything away.

528
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,908
<i>Au contraire!</i>

529
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,076
I id give something away.

530
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,705
I gave away my wagon,

531
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,705
and my best friend.

532
00:15:55,747 --> 00:15:58,291
[clatter]

533
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

534
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,128
I didn't realize you

535
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,128
were better friends

536
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,465
with that beat-up old wagon

537
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:05,465
than you are with me.

538
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,927
Well, it's easy when the

539
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,927
wagon is a better friend.

540
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,721
<i>It</i> would have never

541
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,721
traded<i> you</i> away!

542
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,180
That's ridiculous.

543
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,141
Oh, it<i> is</i> ridiculous.

544
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,102
In fact, this whole

545
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:18,102
tour is ridiculous.

546
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,397
I don't even know why I

547
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:21,397
invited you in the first place!

548
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,317
Well. Maybe I should

549
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,317
just head home.

550
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,653
I think that's a

551
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,653
very good idea.

552
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,531
And you can take this horrible,

553
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:30,531
giant caravan with you!

554
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:31,449
Fine!

555
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,366
Good!

556
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,665
[grunting]

557
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:39,791
[snap]

558
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,501
[scream]

559
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,418
[thud]

560
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:53,095
Goodness! Ms. Powerful.

561
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,015
But where is

562
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,015
your assistant?

563
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,267
I had hoped providing you

564
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,267
with a more comfortable

565
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,228
means of conveyance would

566
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,228
allow you to once more

567
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,983
dazzle the crowds with

568
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,983
mystifying feats of magic!

569
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,735
Normally, that sort of

570
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,735
flattery would suffice,

571
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:11,990
but today we must discuss your

572
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:11,990
dishonest and unfair procurement

573
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,950
of my wagon!

574
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,327
I desired your wagon and

575
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:16,327
provided one of equal

576
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,287
or better value in return.

577
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,666
It seems like a perfectly

578
