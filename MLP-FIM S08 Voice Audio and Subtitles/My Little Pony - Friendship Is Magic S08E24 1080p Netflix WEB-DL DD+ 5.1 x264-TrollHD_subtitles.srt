remember, study groups are

578
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:04,959
both fun and effective!

579
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,045
It's been great having sludge

580
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,045
show me how to be a real dragon,

581
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,088
but twilight just

582
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,088
doesn't get it.

583
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,257
What do you mean?

584
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,134
She can't handle how good

585
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:14,134
at being a dragon sludge is.

586
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,596
Maybe someday I'll be able to

587
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,596
lay around doing nothing

588
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,056
as well as he does.

589
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,973
What?

590
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,141
Well, not now, of course.

591
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,102
I'm too busy bringing

592
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,102
him pony stuff

593
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,104
so he can show me what a

594
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:25,104
dragon would do with it.

595
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,440
So, sludge just lays around

596
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,276
while you wait on

597
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,276
him claw and tail?

598
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,030
Uh, dragons are

599
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,030
rude and rebellious,

600
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,783
but they aren't lazy lumps who

601
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:36,783
take advantage of their kids.

602
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,660
Now I'm really confused.

603
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,161
Me too.

604
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,873
Why don't you tell me

605
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,873
everything sludge said

606
00:18:43,915 --> 00:18:45,207
about being a dragon.

607
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:48,586
Hey!

608
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:49,712
What's going on, son?

609
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,840
Twilight doesn't like having

610
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,840
real dragons in the castle

611
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,383
so I told her we're moving out.

612
00:18:54,425 --> 00:18:56,094
[choke]

613
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,136
You what?

614
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,178
Spike!

615
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,848
I found the perfect cave

616
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,848
where you two can live.

617
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,977
There aren't even any

618
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:03,977
comfortable rocks inside.

619
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,561
That does

620
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:05,561
sound perfect.

621
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,479
No, it doesn't!

622
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,818
I mean, I'm not sure I've fully

623
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,818
demonstrated all the ways

624
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,235
a dragon would live here.

625
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,697
But we're not gonna live here

626
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,697
anymore, so it doesn't matter.

627
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,158
It matters to me!

628
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:24,204
I want to make sure you have

629
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:24,204
all the knowledge you need.

630
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,498
But I do!

631
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,668
Dad, you've already

632
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,668

Argh! Stop!

640
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,939
I'm not your father!

641
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,939
What?

642
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,151
I just said that to get in

643
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:53,151
on this sweet castle life.

644
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:57,780
So you pretended to be my dad?

645
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,076
Na nana. Don't look at

646
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,076
me like that, kid.

647
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:03,953
I did what any dragon would do.

648
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,205
No, you didn't.

649
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,250
Hey, I saw an opportunity

650
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,250
and I took it.

651
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,294
That's what dragons do.

652
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:14,755
No. It isn't.

653
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,256
You know what?

654
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,256
I don't need this.

655
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,257
I'm out of here.

656
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:19,510
Enjoy livin' in pony town.

657
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,387
[spike sighs]

658
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,181
I'm taking this pillow.

659
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,350
I can't believe I thought

660
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,350
somepony like that

661
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,187
could show me how

662
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:29,187
to be anything.

663
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:34,650
It must be hard growing up not

664
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:34,650
really knowing who you are.

665
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,276
That's the thing.

666
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,239
I know exactly who I am,

667
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:40,239
and how I got that way.

668
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:45,578
Um, twilight?

669
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,373
Oh. Hi. Where's

670
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:49,373
your father?

671
00:20:49,415 --> 00:20:50,917
He's gone.

672
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,212
Turns out he wasn't what a real

673
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:54,212
dragon should be after all.

674
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,255
He also wasn't my real dad.

675
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,551
Oh, spike I'm so sorry.

676
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,302
I'm the one who's sorry.

677
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,223
You were just worried about

678
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,223
me and I lost my temper.

679
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,101
Sludge was just a

680
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,101
great big phony.

681
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,310
I have to say I'm not surprised.

682
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,480
There's no way a dragon like

683
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:13,480
that was related to you.

684
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,192
But if you still want to

685
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,192
search for your real family,

686
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:19,319
I'd understand if you spent

687
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:19,319
more time in the dragonlands.

688
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:20,320
I don't think so.

689
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:24,324
I already know who

my real family is.

Besides.

693
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,165
there's no way I'm living

694
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,165
