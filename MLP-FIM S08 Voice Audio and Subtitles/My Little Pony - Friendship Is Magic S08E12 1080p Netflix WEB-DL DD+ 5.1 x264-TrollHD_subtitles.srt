blame us for it!

585
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,144
Or how gum can be so sticky!

586
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,812
[knocking]

587
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,106
Sorry to interrupt,

588
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:50,106
Miss Cheerilee,

589
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,192
but can I borrow Apple Bloom,

590
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:53,192
Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?

591
00:19:55,486 --> 00:20:02,493
<i>♪ [sombre military music] ♪</i>

592
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,915
We didn't do anything

593
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,915
wrong, we promise!

594
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,126
I know that. Now.

595
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,170
Which is why I wanted

596
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,170
to talk to you.

597
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,797
Wait. So we're

598
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,797
not in trouble?

599
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,215
Just the opposite.

600
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,093
Cozy Glow, is there

601
00:20:16,256 --> 00:20:19,093
something you'd like to say?

602
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,971
This is all my fault.

603
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,473
I messed up my

604
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,473
test on purpose,

605
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,600
so we could all go

606
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:26,600
to school together!

607
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,644
I'm sorry.

608
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:30,270
Thank you, Cozy Glow.

609
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,481
Honesty is one of the

610
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,481
pillars of friendship.

611
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:34,483
But you already know that.

612
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,235
Which is why I'd like

613
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,235
to give you these.

614
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,285
They're honorary diplomas,

615
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,956
making y'all official

616
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,956
graduates of this here school.

617
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,875
You've more than

618
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,875
earned them.

619
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,668
Without even

620
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:52,668
having to study!

621
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:01,010
Yeah!

622
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:06,515
We are grad-u-ates!

623
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:06,515
We are grad-u-ates!

624
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,393
And, if you're interested, I

625
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:09,393
think Starlight has a place

626
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,729
for you at my school after all.

627
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,189
We can stay?

628
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,189
Really?

629
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,189
Wooo hooo!

630
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,775
We could use some good

631
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:15,775
friendship tutors on staff.

632
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,485
And I hear you're

633
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:18,485
the best out there.

634
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,071
Then what're we

635
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,071
waiting for?

636
00:21:20,113 --> 00:21:22,156
Let's get tutoring!

637
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,533
C'mon, Cozy!

638
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:28,454
And that's why this school needs

639
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:28,454
you as our guidance counselor.
