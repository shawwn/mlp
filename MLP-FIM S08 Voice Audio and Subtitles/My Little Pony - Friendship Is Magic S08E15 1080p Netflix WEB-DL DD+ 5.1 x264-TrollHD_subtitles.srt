Do you know how

581
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,778
lucky you all are?

582
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,239
With your stories about

583
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:53,239
sharing, and kindness,

584
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,574
and getting together

585
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,574
with everycreature

586
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,909
that you care about?

587
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,579
But... Griffons do

588
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,579
that too, don't they?

589
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,416
Some holiday

590
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,416
about a moon?

591
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,125
Blue Moon Festival.

592
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,212
The one time of year

593
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,212
when Griffons are

594
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:08,212
nice to each other.

595
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,631
Well, as nice as we can be.

596
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,177
<i>Families get together to</i>

597
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,177
<i>eat and then complain</i>

598
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,177
<i>about the food.</i>

599
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,555
<i>And give each other</i>

600
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,555
<i>presents they don't like.</i>

601
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,933
<i>And mostly just try not</i>

602
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:19,933
<i>to yell at each other.</i>

603
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,769
Well, at least you get

604
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,769
to be with your family!

605
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,270
No...

606
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,813
Because I don't have a family.

607
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,150
[Sandbar]<i> What about</i>

608
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,150
<i>Grandpa Gruff?</i>

609
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,235
[Gallus]<i> That's just his name.</i>

610
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,362
<i>He's not anygriff's</i>

611
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,362
<i>actual grandpa.</i>

612
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,367
<i>I felt like I never had</i>

613
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:38,367
<i>a place in Griffonstone.</i>

614
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:46,292
Then I came here,

615
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:46,292
and well, met all of you.

616
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,544
So I don't want to

617
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,544
go home for the break.

618
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,422
And that's why I did it.

619
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,801
[gasp] Griffon mess

620
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,801
up decorations?

621
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,927
Yeah.

622
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,136
It was me.

623
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,430
I put goo powder in

624
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,430
the Fire of Friendship.

625
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,181
[gasps]

626
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,559
So it wasn't Ocellus?

627
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,562
Why would you ruin

628
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,562
things for us?

629
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,230
I didn't plan to!

630
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,816
I just figured if I

631
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,816
made a mess,

632
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,401
our teachers would make

633
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,401
us stay to clean up.

634
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,403
We'd be together

635
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,403
a little longer.

636
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:16,948
Well. It worked, didn't it?

637
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,282
Better than I thought.

638
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,993
When Headmare Twilight

639
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:19,993
threatened to cancel

640
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,537
winter break, that

641
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,537
meant I would get to

642
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:23,537
be with all of you,

643
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,456
through the entire holiday!

644
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:27,583
That's why I didn't confess.

645
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,294
So why are you

646
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,294
admitting this now?

647
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,214
I hated seeing all you fighting

648
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:34,214
and blaming each other.

649
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,217
That's the opposite of what

650
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,217
all your holidays mean.

651
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,761
Except maybe yours, Smolder.

652
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,557
I can't keep all of you from

653
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,557
the happiness of your homes

654
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,685
and families just

655
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,685
because I feel bad.

656
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,229
I'm sorry.

657
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,899
Don't worry, you won't

658
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,899
have to tell our teachers.

659
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,233
I will.

660
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,319
[Twilight] You don't have to.

661
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,570
We already know.

662
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,741
We kinda guessed

663
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,741
it was you.

664
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,536
But we wanted to give you

665
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,536
the chance to tell the truth.

666
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,038
I'm proud that you did.

667
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,914
And I'm glad to see you've

668
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:06,914
been paying attention

669
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,834
in Professor Applejack's

670
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,834
honesty classes.

671
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,961
But you're still gonna

672
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:11,961
have to make amends.

673
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:16,049
And stay over break for

674
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:16,049
extra friendship lessons,

675
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:16,049
by yourself.

676
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,259
I'll stay with him.

677
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,636
Me, too!

678
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,513
Yona stay also!

679
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,806
I'm staying!

680
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:27,393
What?

681
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:28,853
All right.

682
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,523
I guess pony holidays

683
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:32,523
can't be that bad.

684
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,358
Now you can finally

685
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,358
know what it's like

686
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,570
to spend Hearth's Warming with

687
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,570
friends who care about you.

688
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,076
Looks like they don't really

689
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:43,076
need any extra lessons.

690
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,078
Since you obviously know

691
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,078
that Hearth's Warming

692
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,747
is about coming

693
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,747
together, I'd be honored

694
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,416
if all of you would

695
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,416
join my friends as guests

696
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,667
at our holiday table.

697
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:55,421
[happy chatter]

698
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,590
After we finish cleaning up.

699
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,842
[chattering]

700
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,391
Hey, this reminds

701
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,391
me of another story!

702
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:12,980
The Time I Almost Spilled

703
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:12,980
Grape Juice on the White Couch.

704
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,399
Does it have a

705
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:15,399
depressing ending?

706
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,735
I'm not sure pony

707
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:17,735
stories work that way.

708
