Can you come to Twilight's class

I couldn't decide between

00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,696
the boots and the stilettos,

589

I owe you an apology, too.

Buckball may not be my thing,

less than mine.

So... does this mean

we're still friends?

Yeah! Ha ha!

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,244
Wait. That tunnel

[Twilight] Not exactly.

You mean... this was a

setup to make us get along?

Sorry to interfere,

00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,266

Always. I think we just

630
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:43,283
needed a teensy reminder.

631
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,286
Yeah. We don't have to
