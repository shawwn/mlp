00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:13,441
expand my clinic a bit.

391
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,237
Many creatures need healing

392
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,237
in this modern world.

393
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,739
Oh! Looks like you

394
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,739
could use some too.

395
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,076
What's got you

396
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,076
heartsick, Rockhoof?

397
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:29,207
Thing is, I can't do

398
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:29,207
my old job like Flash.

399
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:31,209
Or adapt like Mistmane.

400
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,878
Or succeed at something

401
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:33,878
new like Somnambula.

402
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,548
Or go home, like you.

403
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,798
Give it time.

404
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,094
Even Starswirl's still

405
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,094
learning about friendship.

406
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,429
[Applejack] Yeah!

407
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,390
And I bet Stygian took

408
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,390
plenty of time to fit in.

409
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,350
[Twilight] Hey,

410
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:47,350
look what I found!

411
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,852
"Me and My Shadow,"

412
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,852
the third hit novel

413
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,938
by former villain Stygian.

414
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,524
I'm impressed! He's

415
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,524
really thriving!

416
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:55,774
[moan]

417
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,903
Rockhoof? Where are

418
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,903
you going?

419
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,238
I'm not sure.

420
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,241
Maybe I just don't belong

421
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,241
in this modern world.

422
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,538
Now this here is a

423
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,538
right mash of apples.

424
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,873
'Stead of solving

425
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,873
Rockhoof's problem,

426
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,084
we made him feel even worse.

427
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,378
I'll tell you the

428
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,378
real problem here!

429
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,424
We haven't given Rockhoof the

430
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,424
chance to be who he really is.

431
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,469
A pony with a metal shovel

432
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,469
and a heart of gold?

433
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,512
A hero!

434
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:28,933
What we need to do is find him

435
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:28,933
a job that's as epic as he is!

436
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:33,146
Hm. I might know

437
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:33,146
just the thing...

438
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,651
I'm honored to serve

439
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,651
in the Hippogriff Navy,

440
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,110
General Seaspray.

441
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,446
I promise I'll prove my worth.

442
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,822
Think nothing of it.

443
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:47,327
I know how hard it is

444
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:47,327
to adapt to a new home.

445
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,079
After our many years

446
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,079
below the waves,

447
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:53,541
land customs seemed strange.

448
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,586
Like you didn't fit in, no

449
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,586
matter how hard you tried?

450
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:59,880
As though the world had

451
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:59,880
moved on without us.

452
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:01,591
Never fear, Rockhoof.

453
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:08,222
We shall be as brothers in this

454
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:08,222
bright future above the waves.

455
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,184
Uh, why do the

456
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,184
Hippogriffs need ships

457
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,186
if they can turn

458
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,186
into seaponies?

459
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,979
Maybe they just like cruises?

460
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,397
General!

461
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,108
The fog's too thick to see

462
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,108
our way out of the harbor!

463
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:21,820
[rushing water]

464
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,322
Heave to, swabbies!

465
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:29,577
Halt the ship and hold

466
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:29,577
her till the fog passes!

467
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,078
Wait, General!

468
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,498
We can navigate the same way

469
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,498
my Coltic ancestors traveled

470
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,877
through the Selkie Mists!

471
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:37,877
We'll look to the stars!

472
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,546
There in the

473
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,546
northwest sky

474
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,507
is the constellation

475
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:42,507
for O'Bridle's Pelt!

476
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:45,009
Steer the ship toward that!

477
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,845
You heard the pony, crew!

478
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,388
Make full sail!

479
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,978
Yeehaw! Rockhoof did it!

480
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,313
[smash]

481
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,524
But... I don't understand!

482
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,360
The stars have always

483
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:02,360
steered me true!

484
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,446
Oh, no. Stars can move

485
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:05,446
slowly over time.

486
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,783
They must look different now

487
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:08,783
than over a thousand years ago.

488
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,370
It was an honor serving

489
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:12,370
with you, Rockhoof.

490
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,957
But it seems our paths lie

491
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,957
in different directions.

492
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,507
Hey,

493
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,507
mistakes happen.

494
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,051
We'll think of something

495
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:27,051
else for you to do!

496
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,387
Oh, there's no need, lass.

497
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,681
I already know what

498
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,681
I want to do next.

499
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,224
Really? What?

500
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,393
I heard there's a

501
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,393
statue spell

502
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,187
that sends creatures

503
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,187
into stone sleep.

504
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,189
I want you to cast it.

505
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,982
On me.

506
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,234
[gasp]

507
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:48,698
[Twilight] No!

508
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,532
[Rockhoof] Yes!

509
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,825
-No!

510
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:50,825
-Aye!

511
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,577
[groan]

512
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,453
No!

513
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:54,370
AYE!

514
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,538
Hey guys.

515
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,624
Need me to help you

516
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,624
decide something?

517
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,044
Rockhoof wants me to cast a

518
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,044
spell to turn him into a statue.

519
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,838
The answer is no.

520
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,174
Well, it should be aye, because

521
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,174
I wouldn't even be here

522
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,843
to be turned into a statue

523
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,763
if Twilight hadn't cast a

524
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,763
spell in the first place!

525
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,222
[stomp]

526
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,684
Whoa. I thought you were

527
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:16,684
arguing over ice cream flavors.

528
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:18,519
The answer is still no!

529
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,021
Why would you want to

530
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,021
be turned into stone?

531
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,942
Because I'm a relic

532
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,942
of a bygone age.

533
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,485
I belong in a museum.

534
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,486
Safe.

535
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,487
Preserved.

536
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,113
Untouched.

537
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:30,990
I don't belong in this time.

538
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,159
It's up to you to

539
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,159
make that right.

540
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,119
But there has to

541
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,119
be a better way!

542
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,288
Twilight, please understand.

543
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,999
I want to be remembered

544
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,999
as the hero I was.

545
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,209
Not the disappointment

546
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,209
I've become.

547
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,711
But you're not!

548
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,212
Rockhoof, wait!

549
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,383
Spike, can you teach

550
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:49,383
my class today?

551
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,136
You're not really going to

552
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,136
turn him to stone, are you?

553
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,054
Only because it's temporary.

554
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,890
As soon as I think

555
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,890
of a new solution,

556
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:57,517
we'll wake Rockhoof up.

557
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,145
I know he has more to offer the

558
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:01,145
world as a pony than a statue.

559
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,358
Did you hear Rockhoof caught all

560
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:05,358
the bees in the Everfree Forest,

561
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,985
and gave 'em to

562
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,985
Zecora as a gift?

563
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,196
Wow! Terramar said Rockhoof

564
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:10,196
called down the stars

565
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,615
and sunk the whole

566
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,615
Hippogriff navy!

567
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,535
He's definitely weird.

568
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:15,535
But in a fun way.

569
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,162
You never know what's

570
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,162
gonna happen next with him.

571
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,957
Professor Rockhoof best pony!

572
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,750
Hey, class.

573
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,628
Welcome to the Theory and

574
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,628
Defense of Friendship.

575
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,963
Another sub?

576
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,465
Let me start by telling

577
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:29,465
you we don't get homework,

578
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,218
and we only do field trips.

579
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,887
Yeah, nice try.

580
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,305
Twilight sent me to tell

581
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,305
you she won't be in today

582
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,892
'cause she has to cast a stone

583
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:38,892
sleep spell on Rockhoof.

584
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:40,434
[gasp]

585
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,436
Like Discord? But why?

586
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:44,230
Rockhoof isn't a bad guy.

587
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,193
Your instructions are

588
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,193
to write an essay on

589
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,111
"Heroism: And What It

590
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,111
Means To You."

591
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,197
No!

592
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,240
Oh, don't worry.

593
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,909
It doesn't have to

594
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,909
be a long essay.

595
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,287
Maybe like this?

596
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,707
Or on three legs... Hmm.

597
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:07,086
What will give the wee birds

598
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:07,086
fewer places to uh, decorate?

599
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,546
Professor Rockhoof!

600
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,007
Dragon said you want

601
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:11,007
to turn into stone!

602
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,343
Yona not believe it!

603
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:17,680
Aye, I'm afraid it's true, lass.

604
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,935
But... Pony need finish

605
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:21,935
Ursa Major story for class!

606
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,229
It's sweet of you to try

607
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,229
to get me to stay, Yona.

608
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,858
But... I'm afraid old

609
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:28,858
stories like mine

610
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,194
aren't worth anything

611
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,194
in this day and age.

612
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,197
Fine! If Pony no want

613
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,197
tell Yona story,

614
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,324
then Yona tell Pony story!

615
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:41,287
From class report!

616
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,373
"When Yona come to Pony

617
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:44,373
school, Yona not fit in.

618
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,208
Pony ways strange.

619
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,168
But Yona find friends!

620
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,713
Yona meet Professor Rockhoof.

621
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,800
Pony brave and strong as Yak!

622
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,218
Not afraid! Hero!

623
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,720
When Yona grow up,

624
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:02,600
Yona want to be just like

625
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:02,600
Professor Rockhoof."

626
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,645
Well. Since you went

627
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,645
to the trouble

628
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,564
of writing something

629
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,564
that nice, I suppose

630
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,400
the least I could do is tell

631
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,400
you the rest of the story.

632
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,364
Yona tell whole school

633
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:17,364
Rockhoof is best.

634
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,325
Now all want to hear story.

635
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,204
Ok. I have the spell,

636
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,207
but will you please

637
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,207
reconsider. Rockhoof?

638
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,294
The Ursa Major tried to

639
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,294
grab me by the gullet!

640
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,629
But I ducked her claws!

641
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,339
[gasps]

642
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:36,801
She had me cornered.

643
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,178
So I look at her...

644
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:39,178
she looks at me.

645
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:46,727
And I say, "Sorry you won't be

646
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:46,727
having any dinner tonight, lass!

647
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,647
Guess you'll just have

648
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,647
to grin and bear it!"

649
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,231
[laughter]

650
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:56,070
And then I tossed her away with

651
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:56,070
my shovel, high into the sky.

652
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,866
And she's been a constellation

653
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:59,866
up there ever since.

654
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:01,325
Or so I'm told.

655
00:20:01,367 --> 00:20:04,203
And that's the end of my story.

656
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:08,248
One more story!

657
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:08,248
One more story!

658
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,751
No no. Thank you

659
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,751
for listening.

660
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:12,252
But it's time to say good-bye.

661
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:15,715
Wait.

662
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,134
You said there wasn't anything

663
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,134
in this time you were good at.

664
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,219
What about telling stories?

665
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:24,264
It was just a tall tale...

666
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,767
One that captured the

667
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,767
hearts and imagination

668
00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:29,020
of everycreature here.

669
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,981
Plus pony story super fun!

670
00:20:32,023 --> 00:20:35,193
[cheers]

671
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,237
As the Princess of Friendship,

672
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,237
I'd like to appoint you

673
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:42,200
as Equestria's official

674
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:42,200
Keeper of Tales.

675
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,283
Can you do that?

676
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,203
[shrug sound]

677
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,247
[Rockhoof] I uh, that's

678
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,247
very kind of you.

679
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,084
But I still think these old

680
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,084
bones are more suited

681
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,169
to a museum display.

682
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,963
You are a living

683
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,963
record of our history.

684
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,299
Your stories can inspire and

685
00:20:56,005 --> 00:20:59,299
teach generations to come.

686
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,762
If you're a statue,

687
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,762
that's all lost.

688
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,306
But will I ever really

689
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:06,306
belong in your world?

690
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,975
Rockhoof Yona's friend.

691
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,310
So Rockhoof belongs.

692
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:15,315
You know, that reminds

693
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:15,315
me of another story...

694
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:21,030
Once there was a small Yak that

695
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:21,030
knew more than a great hero.

696
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:24,324
Hey, don't forget the

697
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:24,324
dragons in this one!

698
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,826
Aye, there were dragons.

699
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,411
And ponies.

700
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,830
And plenty of hippogriffs.

701
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,374
Plus a changeling and

702
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:32,374
a griffon that flew...

703
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,005
