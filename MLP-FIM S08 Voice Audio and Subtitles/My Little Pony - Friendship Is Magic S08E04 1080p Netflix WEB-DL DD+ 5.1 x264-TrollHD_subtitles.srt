[thud]

582
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,107
Will somepony tell her

583
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:28,107
to stop saying that!

584
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:31,110
That's it!

585
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:34,072
Fluttershy, I'm afraid

586
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:34,072
you've left me no choice.

587
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,365
You are terminated!

588
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,118
Well! Good luck

589
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,118
replacing me!

590
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,162
Well, thankfully I...

591
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,122
Ahhhaaaahh!

592
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,208
I always thought she

593
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,208
was too controlling.

594
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,878
You-you are

595
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:48,878
terminated too!

596
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,171
Whatever.

597
00:18:51,213 --> 00:18:52,715
Now I... Aiieeeee!

598
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:53,883
I know, right?

599
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:56,176
I mean, O-M...

600
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,846
Actually, you're, like,

601
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,681
totally terminated as well.

602
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,809
Like... OK.

603
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,729
Well, I'm glad

604
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,729
that's ov-aaah!

605
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,315
I guess I owe

606
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,315
everypony an apology.

607
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,776
You think?

608
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,152
I got so caught up

609
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,528
trying to please all of

610
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,528
your customers that...

611
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,155
What customers?

612
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,161
I might have taken my salespony

613
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,161
characters a little too far.

614
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,166
I'm sorry if I

615
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:27,166
hurt your feelings.

616
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,836
You know I was only

617
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,836
pretending, right?

618
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:33,213
[happy chitters]

619
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,215
But Fluttershy, why did you

620
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,215
think you needed to be

621
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,217
somepony else to

622
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,217
run the shop?

623
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,804
I guess acting like the

624
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,804
ponies of Saddle Row

625
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,348
gave me the confidence to

626
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,348
interact with them.

627
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,351
Darling, I'd never trust some

628
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,351
horrible Saddle Row pony

629
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:47,227
to run my shop.

630
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,396
That's why I wanted

631
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,396
a friend to do it.

632
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,359
Well, I'd definitely

633
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,359
rather be myself anyway,

634
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,030
even if I don't exactly have

635
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,030
what it takes to be a shop pony.

636
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,865
I wouldn't sell

637
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,865
yourself short.

638
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,241
Those salespony characters

639
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,241
all came from you.

640
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,162
Yeah. I think you totally

641
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,162
have what it takes.

642
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,956
Maybe a little too much.

643
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:08,248
Indeed.

644
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,250
You have all the inner

645
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,250
strength you need,

646
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,211
but I think we

647
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,211
prefer it coming

648
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,714
from our sweet,

649
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,714

inspiration I'm looking for!

653
00:20:24,182 --> 00:20:26,433
And last one...there!

654
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,394
The missing piece for

00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,394
my new collection:

Oh, it's lovely, Rarity. I'm

00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:45,870
just sorry you had to leave

662
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:47,872
the Canterlot Royal

Oh, darling, making the perfect

665
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,792
dress is scads more satisfying

666
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:53,293

I certainly hope you aren't

trying to undercut the

671
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,348

672
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:06,348
out and debuting it here.

Have you considered

675
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,310
the possibility

676
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,813
that the Royal Fashion Show is

677
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,813
trying to undercut Rarity's

678
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,523
by continuing on

in Canterlot
