We're still under

This is all just

00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:57,754

I can't find any

They must all be captured.

It's not real.

Yes, it is!

403
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,743
He's back and I'm never going

404
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,743
to see another sunset

405
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,621

407
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,914
He's going to take

408
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,914
away everything I love.

409
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,544
I'm going to be trapped

down here forever.

411
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,004
I'm afraid of

412
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:40,004
being trapped too.

413
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,922
I'm scared of

415
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:42,923
Really?

00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,509
Yeah.

417
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,678
And I was stuck in a

418
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,678
room that kept shrinking.

419
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,930
But I realized I had to face my

420
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,930
fear and I found the way out.

421
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,809
This is your test.

422
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,809
He isn't really here.

424
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,396
But what if he is?

425
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,732
Then tell him exactly

426
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,732
what you think of him.

427
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,404

and a goofy crown!

You thought you could scare us

into doing whatever you wanted!

435
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,379
But we learned that together

436
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:21,379
we're stronger than you!

437
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,963
And now that

00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,963
we're rid of you,

439
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:27,968
we're gonna soar through the

441

I did it!

00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:40,981
I told him!

00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,985
OK, hug time later.

449
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,946
We still have to get

back to the library.

You're a changeling.

452
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,367
Just change back.

453
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,035
I can't.

Maybe my past

00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,498
was so horrible,

00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,460
it's still inside me just

That's not who you are anymore.

You've changed.

462
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,843
Maybe we can't really

463
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,843
change that much.

But ever since school started,

469
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:19,228
I've realized that sometimes

470
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,397
I kinda don't mind cute stuff.

admit she likes tea parties,

474

00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,591
notes and saw this

584
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,259
and didn't know

585
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,259
what to think.

586
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,219
We're better than

587
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,219
all right!

588
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,722
We just got tested by

589
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,722
the Tree of Harmony!

590
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,433
And we totally passed!

591
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,561
The Tree of

592
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,561
Harmony? Here?

593
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,772
Yeah! Well. Below here.

594
00:19:49,814 --> 00:19:51,231
Under the school!

595
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,360
We found this and went down and

596
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,360
met the Tree and Gallus was all

597
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,487
"friendship is not

598
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,487
in our nature"

599
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,238
and the tree was like what?

600
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,699
And it tested us!

601
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,659
Long story short.

602
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,661
Friendship IS in our nature.

603
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:05,621
The Tree said so.

604
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,749
I guess we should tell somepony

605
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,749
there's a giant magical hole

606
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,209

We have to tell our

610
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,630
professors about this!

611
00:20:14,672 --> 00:20:15,756
They won't believe--

612

You can't!

613
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,258
Why no?

614
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,761
Because it's my fault!

00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,263
You were all getting

616
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,263
along so well

617
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,475
and I felt left out.

618
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,475
I was jealous.

619
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:30,437
And it upset you so much the

620
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:30,437
Tree of Harmony had to test you!

621
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,192
Oh! I'm gonna get

622
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,192
expelled for sure!

to do anything right now.

631
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,829
Yeah. But we can't

632
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,829
go to sleep.

633
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,455
We'll miss the test.

634
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,917
The test!

What if I tell Professor Sparkle

640
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:02,302
I needed help organizing

641
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,847
these books and you were all

642
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,847
kind enough to pitch in?

643

I'll get you an extension.

That's nice of you.

I'm just so sorry I
