Sorry, y'all.

We woulda been here sooner but

597
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,397

601
00:17:46,941 --> 00:17:49,360
did not!

Why? So you can laugh

606
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:56,075

00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,327
Hey hey! We're

608
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,327

Friends?

610
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,998
You left me alone

611
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,998

618

619
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,014
I wanted a fun trip

620
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,014

621
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,516

away with plans

623
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:22,142

624
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,688
If you want to forget it all and

625
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,688
head home, I won't be offended.

626
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,482
I just want us to stop fighting.

631
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:33,696
I'm sorry, too.

632
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,365
I should've just told you

633
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:36,365
I'll never like camping.

634
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,785
Also, I'll never

635
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,785

636

651

652
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,602
