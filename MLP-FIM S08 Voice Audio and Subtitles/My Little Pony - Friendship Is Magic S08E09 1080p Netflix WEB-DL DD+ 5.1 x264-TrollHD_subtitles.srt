585
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,286
Yeah, that was super-dangerous.

586
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,997
Talk about commitment!

587
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:53,293
We know it's too early to

588
00:20:49,207 --> 00:20:53,293
pick the Teacher of the Month.

589
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,297
But we'd like you to consider

590
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:57,297
Rainbow Dash and Applejack.

591
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,258
Thank you for telling me!

592
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,178
I'm so glad to hear your

593
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,178
field trip was a success.

594
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,931
I'll make sure to schedule

595
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,931
another one right away!

596
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,934
[cheers]

597
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,897
You were actually just competing

598
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,897
the entire time, weren't you?

599
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,149
To tell ya the truth?

600
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:16,400
Yeah.

601
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:19,070
Well, not all the time.

602
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,321
I agreed with you for

603
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,321
the whole nature walk!

604
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,366
Only cause you were anglin' for

605
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,366
that Teacher of the Month award.

606
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,325
[groan]

607
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,787
You were the one

608
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,787
doing the angling.

609
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:32,625
