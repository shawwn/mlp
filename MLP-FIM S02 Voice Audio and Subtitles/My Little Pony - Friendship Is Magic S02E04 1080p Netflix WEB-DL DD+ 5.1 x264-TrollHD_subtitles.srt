I MET SOMEPONY TONIGHT WHO WAS

772
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,663
HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM --

773
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,915
YOUR SISTER PRINCESS LUNA.

774
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,417
SHE TAUGHT ME

775
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,417
THAT ONE OF THE BEST THINGS

776
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,170
YOU CAN DO WITH FRIENDSHIP

777
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:54,170
IS TO GIVE IT TO OTHERS

778
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,172
AND HELP THEM FIND IT

779
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,172

00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,590

HAS LEARNED

783
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,178
THAT EVEN IF SOMEPONY SEEMS

784
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,178
A LITTLE INTIMIDATING,

785
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,971
EVEN SCARY, WHEN YOU

786
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:03,971
OFFER THEM YOUR FRIENDSHIP,

787
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:08,184
YOU'LL DISCOVER A WHOLE NEW PONY

DIDN'T GO OVER,

792
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,691
THIS STILL TURNED OUT TO BE

793
