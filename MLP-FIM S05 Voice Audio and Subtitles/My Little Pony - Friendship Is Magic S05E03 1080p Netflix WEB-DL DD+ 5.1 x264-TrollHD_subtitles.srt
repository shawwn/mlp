00:11:52,709 --> 00:11:54,250
and we'll see how it looks?

385
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,667
Uh huh!

386
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:59,250
Spike, you're back!

387
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,542
How do I look?

388
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:03,500
Great!

389
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:06,375
And more importantly,

390
00:12:03,542 --> 00:12:06,375
how does the castle look?

391
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,125
Great!

392
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,166
I can't wait to go

393
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,166
home and see it!

394
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,125
Great!

395
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,667
I mean, NO!

396
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:15,583
I mean, uh, I'm not

397
00:12:12,709 --> 00:12:15,583
quite ready to go yet.

398
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,458
Why don't we have a massage?

399
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,125
I was really hoping to

400
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,125
get uh, this thingy!

401
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,166
The extra strength hot

402
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,166
stone deep tissue massage?

403
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,458
[gulp]

404
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,709
Yep.

405
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,166
I think I'll just have

406
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,166
a traditional massage,

407
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:30,166
but you go for it.

408
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,500
Did somepony order massages?

409
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:33,500
[crash]

410
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:34,875
YEAH!

411
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:37,375
Let's DO this, little dragon!

412
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:40,667
[crash]

413
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,291
Oh, I hate it when

414
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,291
he does that.

415
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,208
Come with me, Princess.

416
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,166
Come on, Rarity.

417
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,166
Everypony has taken

418
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:51,166
somethin' out except you.

419
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,500
I know!

420
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:53,834
I simply can't decide.

421
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,792
How about this?

422
00:12:55,834 --> 00:12:57,208
No! Not that!

423
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,583
Anything but that!

424
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:00,208
How about these?

425
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,583
But those brighten

426
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,583
up the whole room!

427
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:03,458
They're my favorite accent!

428
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,291
Then let's lose the curtains.

429
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,583
The room wouldn't

430
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,583
need brightening

431
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,375
if they weren't

432
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,375
making it so dark!

433
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:09,375
Not them!

434
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:11,333
They're my favorite, too!

435
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,959
They can't all be

436
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,959
your favorite!

437
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,709
OK, I'm taking

438
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,709
down the portrait.

439
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,583
We already know

440
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,583
what we look like.

441
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,542
The room still looks a little

442
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,542
bit cluttered, doesn't it?

443
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,333
Perhaps I'll take

444
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,333
down a poster or two.

445
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,959
Only to be helpful, of course!

446
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,875
OK, everypony calm down.

447
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,375
I'm sure we can find a way

448
00:13:31,917 --> 00:13:34,375
to remove the clutter...

449
00:13:34,417 --> 00:13:35,375
together!

450
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,875
You're absolutely

451
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:36,875
right, dear.

452
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,959
Hey! Those are my

453
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,959
warmin' quilts!

454
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,875
Together!

455
00:13:42,917 --> 00:13:44,917
[popping]

456
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,625
Fluttershy, tell your birds to

457
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,625
stop pecking at my balloons!

458
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,917
I guess they must not like being

459
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:50,917
scared out of their wits

460
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,875
by exploding confetti

461
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:53,875
cannons or something.

462
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,000
But we can't get

463
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,000
rid of the cannons!

464
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,750
I don't remember

465
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,750
where I hid 'em!

466
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:58,917
[pop]

467
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,458
Allow me to help you!

468
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,709
Applejack: Oh no,

469
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,709
I'll help you!

470
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,375
Rainbow: NOT IF I

471
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,375
HELP YOU FIRST!

472
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:08,417
Ah. Great

473
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:08,417
suggestion, Spike.

474
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,917
I feel totally relaxed.

475
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,375
Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow!

476
00:14:14,417 --> 00:14:15,583
You wanna hop on?

477
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,542
Maybe I can get us

478
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,542
to the castle faster.

479
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,709
OW!

480
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,917
I mean, how...

481
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,750
nice is this day?

482
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:29,458
I was hoping we could

483
00:14:26,792 --> 00:14:29,458
take the scenic way back.

484
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,542
I don't know.

485
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:31,750
Come on.

486
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,917
Walking is good for

487
00:14:31,792 --> 00:14:33,917
post-massage circulation.

488
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:35,041
Really?

489
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,583
I've never heard

490
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,583
that theory.

491
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:43,041
[sigh] I really miss

492
00:14:39,667 --> 00:14:43,041
this place, Spike.

493
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,542
We had so many wonderful

494
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,542
memories here.

495
00:14:46,834 --> 00:14:49,417
We did, didn't we?

496
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,625
Oh Spike, I'm so sorry.

497
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,959
Of course losing the Golden Oak

498
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:54,959
Library was hard for you too.

499
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:57,834
I've got an idea!

500
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,667
Why don't we have the

501
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,667
girls add some things

502
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,291
to make the castle feel more

503
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:02,291
like your home as well?

504
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,542
Really?

505
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:04,709
Hop on!

506
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,458
[thud]

507
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,500
Ow!

508
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:12,583
What are you doing?

509
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,667
I, um, I just thought

510
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,667
of what I want.

511
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:18,417
Oh. OK. What is it?

512
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,542
It's a...

513
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,625
Well, I want a...

514
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:22,667
it's - I kinda need a...

515
00:15:22,709 --> 00:15:24,458
A bed.

516
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,041
I thought you said you sleep

517
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,041
like a baby in the castle.

518
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,458
Pfft! Everypony knows babies

519
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,458
are terrible sleepers.

520
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,542
Let's go!

521
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:37,500
There! Now nothing is

522
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:37,500
cluttering the castle!

523
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:38,792
You're right.

524
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:42,041
There is literally NOTHING

525
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:42,041
cluttering this castle!

526
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,041
What do we do now?

527
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,792
I hate to be the bearer

528
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,792
of more bad news,

529
00:15:46,834 --> 00:15:48,500
but it's almost sunset.

530
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:49,959
If we don't figure

531
00:15:48,542 --> 00:15:49,959
this out soon,

532
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,375
it's going to look like we

533
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,375
didn't lift a hoof to help her.

534
00:15:52,417 --> 00:15:54,000
Why is this so hard?

535
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:55,625
We're Twilight's best friends.

536
00:15:55,667 --> 00:15:57,458
This should be easy for us!

537
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,917
She said it herself: if

538
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,917
anypony should be able

539
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,625
to make her feel comfortable

540
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,625
in her new home, it's us.

541
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:05,375
If we can't do it...

542
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,500
...then Twilight will be

543
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:07,500
stuck living in a castle

544
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,792
that just makes her

545
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:09,792
feel sad...

546
00:16:09,834 --> 00:16:11,000
[echoes]

547
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:14,000
...sad...sad.

548
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,709
Wow, Fluttershy, I

549
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,709
didn't know you could be

550
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,125
loud enough to echo.

551
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:24,583
[muttering to

552
00:16:21,417 --> 00:16:24,583
herself]

553
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,667
What do we do?

554
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,667
What do we do?

555
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,375
If Twilight comes home

556
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:28,375
now she'll be like

557
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:29,458
"What did you guys do?"

558
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,041
And we'll have to

559
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,041
be like "NOTHING!"

560
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,709
And then she'll be like

561
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:32,709
"I was counting on you!

562
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,208
Some friends you are!"

563
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,542
and we'll be like "AAAHHH!"

564
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:39,458
[blubbering]

565
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,792
Calm down, Pinkie.

566
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,709
We just need to figure

567
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,709
out what we did wrong

568
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,250
so we can make it right.

569
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,166
Rarity: Well, I didn't

570
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,166
do anything wrong.

571
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,583
I did exactly what I would

572
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,583
do if this were my home.

573
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,667
But it's not your home;

574
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:51,667
it's Twilight's home!

575
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:54,625
Where she keeps all her

576
00:16:51,709 --> 00:16:54,625
Rainbow Dash trophies?

Fluttershy: Maybe we're

579
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,417
all a little guilty

580
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,750

581
00:16:57,458 --> 00:17:00,750

582
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:03,709
Come on, y'all, we just need

583
00:17:00,792 --> 00:17:03,709
to think about Twilight!

584
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,125
What was it she

585
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,125
loved about living

586
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,834
in the Golden Oak Library?

587
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:08,625
Oh, everything!

588
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,417
The books, the

589
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,417

590
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,125
the joy she felt from

591
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:13,125
organizing books.

592
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,291
Remember that time I crashed

593
00:17:13,166 --> 00:17:15,291

596
00:17:18,834 --> 00:17:21,792
[sigh] That was good times.

597
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:23,458
Yeah, for YOU, maybe.

598
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,917
Rarity: Oh and Applejack,

599
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,500
remember when we were stuck

600
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,500
having a sleepover there?

601
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:30,250
That turned out

602
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:30,250
to be so much fun!

603
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,458
Remember the time it got

604
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:33,458
blown up to smithereens?

605
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,542
Wait, no. That

606
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,542
was the worst!

607
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,291
We had a lot of good

608
00:17:37,583 --> 00:17:40,291
memories there, though.

609
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:43,291
That's what made the

610

Golden Oak Library home.

How's that one?

614

Too soft?

615
00:17:50,792 --> 00:17:51,792
Too hard?

616
00:17:51,834 --> 00:17:53,375
Too lumpy?

Oh, thank goodness.

620
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,834
I thought you'd never

621
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,834
find one you liked.

622
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,291
Let's find a salespony

623
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:05,291

624
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,834
