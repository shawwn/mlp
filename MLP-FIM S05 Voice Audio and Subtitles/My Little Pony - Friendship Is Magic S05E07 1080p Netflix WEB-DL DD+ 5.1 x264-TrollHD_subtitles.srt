Why is this so late?

205
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:33,250
Well, I got a little lost after

206
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:33,250
I escaped the flying badgers.

207
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:36,542
Can you point me in the

owe somepony an apology?

577
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,041
Not ME.

578
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,291
Oh, oh.

579
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,667
Ahem, Yes, right.

580
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:08,375
Tree Hugger, I'm sorry that you

581
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:08,375
got caught in the middle of my,

582
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,959
you know, wrath.

583
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,166
Oh, it's all groovy.

584
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:18,750
Um, I need like a few minutes

585
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:18,750
to clear out my chakras

586
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,875
before I can hug you from a

587
00:20:18,792 --> 00:20:21,875
place of authenticity.

588
00:20:21,917 --> 00:20:24,208
Oh, your chakras, yes.

589
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,417
Fair enough.

590
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:29,083
I owe you an apology, Smooze.

591
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,291
I spent the whole evening

592
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:32,291
thinking about my own feelings

593
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:34,125
and never thinking about yours.

594
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,083
Well, friends!

595
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:44,709
I think I may actually grow to

596
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:44,709
like this multiple friend thing!

597
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,250
I like it too.

598
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,250
Hey, it's not a party until

599
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,250
somepony spreads magic-resistant

600
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,166
ooze uncontrollably

601
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,166
over the ballroom!

602
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,291
Come on, Smoozinator,

603
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:55,291
let's dance!

604
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,959
♪♪

605
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,083
I'm sorry,

606
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,083
Princess Celestia.

607
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,542
I thought I could give

608
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:03,542
you a break tonight,

609
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,959
but it turns out I

610
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,959
was in over my head.

611
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,542
You have nothing

612
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,542
to apologize for.

613
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:12,208
This has been the most

614
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:12,208
fun Gala in years!

615
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,542
I know, it

616
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,542
was a-- WHAT?

617
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,750
But there was ooze

618
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,750
all over the place...

619
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,583
and one of the guests

620
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,583
threatened to send somepony

621
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,166
to another dimension.

622
00:21:20,208 --> 00:21:21,458
I know!

623
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,542
Can you imagine how

624
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,542
dull it would have been

625
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,000
if I hadn't invited Discord?

626
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,542
Come on!

627
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:30,875
The night is still young!
