85
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,333

00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,333
the School Board

87
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:42,000

00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,041
and then your mom yelled at you.

376
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,250
We know you wanna change

377
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,250

380
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,709
I was at the School Board

381
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:20,709
Meeting and they didn't approve

382
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,333
my request for the new

383
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,333
playground equipment.

384
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,667
Why not?

385
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,625
There's no money in the budget!

386
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,125
So I checked my Peggy Bank

387
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:30,125
to see if I had enough bits,

388
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,291
but my little Peggy wasn't

389
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:33,291
nearly full enough.

390
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,375
Don't worry, Pip!

391
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,750
We'll meet you back at school!

392
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,000
