00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:07,125
This here, entertainin'

577
00:20:03,709 --> 00:20:07,125
y'all with my klutzin',

578
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,750
that's what I'm

579
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,750
s'posed to be doin'.

580
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,333
I know it now.

581
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:14,000
I didn't mean no harm, honest!

582
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,667
I just ain't never loved nothin'

583
00:20:14,041 --> 00:20:17,667
like I love the rodeo.

584
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:22,792
So I kept on sneakin' back and

585
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:22,792
makin' a big ol' mess a' things.

586
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:27,083
Turns out I was just lookin'

587
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:27,083
at my Cutie Mark all wrong.

588
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:31,667
That may be so, Trouble Shoes,

589
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:31,667
but you still gotta face charges

590
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,542
for the problems you caused.

591
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,500
If I done wrong, I'll see to

592
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:37,500
it that I take my medicine

593
00:20:37,542 --> 00:20:39,333
and square my accounts.

594
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,667
Truth be told, we could

595
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,667
understand all the trouble

596
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,583
with the rodeos.

597
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,417
But why'd ya have to run off

598
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,417
with these here littl'uns

599
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:49,041
last night?

600
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,250
Uh... yeah, about that...

601
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,208
You really want us to clean

602
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:00,208
up all this mess

603
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,917
Trouble Shoes made?

604
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,917
Maybe it'll teach you

605
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:03,917
not to go wanderin' off

606
00:21:03,959 --> 00:21:05,750
after I say not to.

607
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:09,041
Ain't it bad enough that you

608
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:09,041
get to go back to Ponyville

609
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,750
with a shiny trophy and

610
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,750
all we're bringin' back

611
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,417
is these same old

612
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,417
blank flanks?

613
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,000
Y'all helped Trouble Shoes

614
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:17,000
realize what his Cutie Mark

615
00:21:17,041 --> 00:21:18,458
really means.

616
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,792
Ain't that a nice feeling

617
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,792
you can take back with ya?

618
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:24,458
I guess we did make

619
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:24,458
things a little better.

620
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,208
Does feel kinda nice.

621
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,125
So, we can stop now?

622
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:29,667
Nope.
