00:11:58,083 --> 00:12:00,792
things cleared up, we'll--

385
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,458
C'mon, Rarity; we

386
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:03,458
don't have all day!

387
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,375
Where were you on the night

388
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,375
of last night at midnight?

389
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,125
We were here, guarding

390
00:12:06,417 --> 00:12:08,125
the hallway entrance

391
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:09,500
like we were supposed to.

392
00:12:09,542 --> 00:12:11,291
A likely story.

393
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,125
I'm telling you, we

394
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,125
were there all night

395
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,625
and no one went in or

396
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,625
out of that hallway.

397
00:12:17,041 --> 00:12:18,041
Except for you.

398
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,583
What are you trying to say?

399
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,166
Just that there are only two

400
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,166
rooms in the northwest wing:

401
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,166
yours and Spitfire's.

402
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:28,291
So the only other pony who had

403
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:28,291
access to that wing was you.

404
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,125
<i>The waters were getting choppy.</i>

405
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:36,125
<i>Rainbow Dash's tactics</i>

406
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:36,125
<i>were... well, horrid.</i>

407
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,333
<i>It was time for</i>

408
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,333
<i>another approach.</i>

409
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,000
Perhaps I should

410
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,000
take it from here.

411
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,166
You castle guards have

412
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,166
such a difficult job.

413
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:51,125
I'm guessing that at times,

414
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:51,125
it can be rather boring.

415
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,500
[softly] It is. I've counted all

416
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:55,500
345 bolts in the ceiling tiles

417
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,542
293 times.

418
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,375
And of course, being a castle

419
00:12:57,583 --> 00:13:01,375
guard can be thankless work.

420
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:04,625
I'm not saying you did,

421
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:04,625
but if you took a break,

422
00:13:04,667 --> 00:13:06,959
you more than deserved it.

423
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,375
Aw, you're right, we don't

424
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,375
get a lot of recognition

425
00:13:09,417 --> 00:13:10,959
for what we do.

426
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,291
Except for last night when

427
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,291
somepony was nice enough

428
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:14,792
to leave a cake for us.

429
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:18,166
So we did take one little

430
00:13:14,834 --> 00:13:18,166
break when we ate that cake.

431
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:19,542
What kind of cake was it?

432
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,917
Cherry with a

433
00:13:19,583 --> 00:13:20,917
custard filling.

434
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,750
Chocolate.

435
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,750
Was the frosting

436
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,750
vanilla or chocolate?

437
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,625
Was it decorated with

438
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,625
buttercream rosettes?

439
00:13:24,667 --> 00:13:25,709
It was!

440
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,875
Ugh. Who cares how

441
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,875
it was decorated?

442
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:31,250
<i>Rainbow Dash was</i>

443
00:13:28,917 --> 00:13:31,250
<i>questioning my methods,</i>

444
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:33,458
<i>but I knew what I was doing.</i>

445
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
Do you?

446
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:38,250
Oh. Did I say that

447
00:13:34,542 --> 00:13:38,250
one out loud?

448
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,375
I mean, even I think I'm

449
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:41,375
guilty at this point.

450
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,709
I really did want

451
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,709
to fly in that show!

452
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,000
What if I wrote that

453
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:46,000
note when I was asleep?

454
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,959
Do you know what I do when I

455
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,959
sleep? Because I sure don't!

456
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, calm down, Rainbow Dash.

457
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
We'll get to the bottom of this.

458
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,834
There's only one

459
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,834
bakery in Canterlot

460
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,208
that makes a chocolate cherry

461
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:57,208
cake with custard filling

462
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,583
and buttercream frosting

463
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,583
rosettes, and that's...

464
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,458
...Cinnamon Chai's

465
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,458

00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,166
Hello, how can I help you?

00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,542
I've heard you have the best

00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:08,542

Oh! You travel in

473
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,291
the right circles.

474
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,834
We have the only chocolate

475
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,834
cherry custard cake

476
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,125

478
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,291
Oh, no! But somepony's

479
00:14:19,667 --> 00:14:22,291
already bought it.

480
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,250
Who was the lucky pony?

481
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,083
I can't even say!

482
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,083
Why? Because it was

483
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:30,083
somepony famous?

484
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,500
No! Because it

485
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,500
was hard to tell.

486
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,166
She was wearing a trenchcoat,

487
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:37,166
sunglasses, and a scarf

488
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,917
around her head that

489
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,917
covered most of her face.

490
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,166
But I do remember she had a

491
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:44,166
really deep, raspy voice.

492
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,500
Rainbow Dash: What do

493
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,500
you mean raspy?

494
00:14:46,542 --> 00:14:48,458
Well, kinda like yours.

495
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,875
If there's anything else

496
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,875
you can remember, dish!

497
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:55,875
Well, have I got

498
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:55,875
a story for you!

499
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,083
The pony who bought the

500
00:14:55,917 --> 00:14:58,083
cake threw a big fit

501
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,417
when she accidentally got

502
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,417
chocolate ganache on her scarf.

503
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,834
That's terrible! What

504
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,834
color was the scarf?

505
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:09,083
White. No, maybe

506
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:09,083
more of an ivory.

507
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,625
You don't say!

508
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,917
I can't believe you're talking

509
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:13,917
fashion at a time like this.

510
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:17,291
Rainbow, don't panic.

511
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:17,291
I need you to trust me.

512
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,583
Trust you? You've spent

513
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,583
more time changing clothes

514
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:24,125

515
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:24,125

I've found the culprit!

Somepony sent Spitfire away and

framed Rainbow Dash for it.

533
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,875
And that pony was none

00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:14,875

Rarity, I can't believe you

538
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,875
would accuse Wind Rider

539
00:16:23,917 --> 00:16:25,458
of framing me.

00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,083
He's a living legend,

541
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,083
for pony's sake!

542
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,166
All the evidence points to him.

543
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,709
What evidence could

544
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:33,709
you possibly have?

545
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,458
All you did was ask

546
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,458
about cake, admire decor,

547
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,667
and change outfits

548
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,667
a gazillion times.

549
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:40,041
Let me explain.

550
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,750
I never believed you

551
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,750
would send Spitfire away.

552
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:46,125
And when we found the rainbow

553
00:16:42,792 --> 00:16:46,125
hairs in Spitfire's room,

554
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:50,792
I could tell they didn't

555
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:50,792
fall out; they were cut!

556
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:53,750
No pony loses hair in a chunk.

557
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:56,458
And look at the ends;

558
00:16:53,792 --> 00:16:56,458
it's a straight line!

559
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,625
They were clearly

560
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,625
cut with shears!

561
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:01,000
Which means somepony planted it.

562
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,125
Then, when we were examining

563
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:04,125
Spitfire's room...

564
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:08,208
...I smelled something on the

565

566
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,583
Wind Rider's cologne of choice.

567
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,667
Then, in the castle hallway,

568
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:14,667
I noticed some of the damask

569
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,291
curtains fell out of

570
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:17,291
their velvet rope holder,

571
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,792
indicating that somepony had

572
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,792
been hiding behind them,

573
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:23,709
perhaps after they dropped

574
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:23,709
off the fake letter.

575
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,417
Juniper Phoenix is a

576
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,417
very popular fragrance

577
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,792
and anypony could have

578
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,792
moved those curtains.

579
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:32,125
Precisely why I questioned

580
00:17:28,834 --> 00:17:32,125
the castle guards.

581
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,583
They were at their post at

582
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:34,583
the entrance to the hallway

583
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,625
all night except for

584
00:17:34,625 --> 00:17:37,625
a small window of time

585
00:17:37,667 --> 00:17:40,834
when somepony brought them cake.

586
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:45,083
A cake that was ordered by a

587
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:45,083
girl pony with a raspy voice.

588
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,250
Whoever ordered the cake

589
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,250
got a chocolate stain

590
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:51,125
on their ivory scarf, and

591
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:51,125
I couldn't help but notice

592
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,333
Wind Rider's scarf is tied

593
00:17:51,166 --> 00:17:54,333
in a tight Windsor knot

594
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,750
instead of its usual

595
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,750
loose slipknot.

596
00:17:56,792 --> 00:18:01,750
And why is that? Is it to

597
00:17:56,792 --> 00:18:01,750
hide... the chocolate stain?

598
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:03,834
[gasps]

599
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,750
This is preposterous.

600
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:09,250
Wonderbolts, you don't

601
00:18:05,792 --> 00:18:09,250
believe a word of this, right?

602
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,125
Just admit it! You're as

603
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,125
guilty of framing Rainbow Dash

604
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,166
as you are of ruining

605
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,166
that ivory scarf!

606
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:18,542
Fine. You caught me! I did it.

607
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:21,041
But why, Wind Rider?

608
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,834
Is it because I took

609
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,834
the last broccoli

610
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,875
at the dinner and you

611
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,875
really really wanted it?

612
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:28,542
No. It was because he was afraid

613
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:32,208
that you would break his long

614
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:32,208
distance Wonderbolt record.

615
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,959
I heard him when Spitfire said

616
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,917
you were close to

617
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,917
breaking his record.

618
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:38,959
He said and I quote, "heh heh."

619
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,041
That's the polite but

620
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,041
disingenuous laugh you make

621
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,875
when you want to seem happy

622
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,875
but really you're not.

623
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:45,667
I thought if I could

624
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:45,667
get Rainbow Dash

625
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,834
kicked out of the

626
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:47,834
Wonderbolts forever,

627
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,125
my record would be preserved.

628
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,333
Really? That is so not cool.

629
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,959
I thought you were the coolest

630
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:56,959
Wonderbolt ever until now.

631
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,667
I did what I had to do

632
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,667
to protect my record.

633
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,417
Sometimes, you gotta play

634
00:18:59,709 --> 00:19:02,417
dirty to be the best.

635
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,875
That's not what being a

636
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:04,875
Wonderbolt is all about.

637
00:19:04,917 --> 00:19:06,333
She's right!

638
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,500
Wonderbolts look

639
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,500
out for each other.

640
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,542
Which reminds me,

641
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:11,542
where is Spitfire?

642
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,291
I sent her the letter

643
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,291
pretending to be Stormy Flare.

644
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,834
I told her I had Pegasitus

645
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,834
and the only cure

646
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,458
is the Ice Iris in

647
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,458
the Crystal Mountains.

648
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,625
No wonder she's

649
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,625
been gone so long.

650
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:25,000
Ice Irises are almost

651
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:25,000
impossible to find in spring!

652
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,792
The Crystal Mountains are too

653
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,792
far for anypony to make it there

654
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,250
and back before the

655
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:30,250
Royal Garden opening.

656
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:34,083
Rainbow Dash, we need you

657
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:34,083
to fly in Spitfire's place.

658
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,709
But Spitfire shouldn't have to

659
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,709
miss this. I'm gonna get her.

660
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,458
Well, you'll never

661
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,458
make it in time!

662
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,875
Then there's no time to lose!

663
00:19:41,917 --> 00:19:46,500
♪♪

664
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:48,500
Rainbow Dash is still gone!

665
00:19:48,542 --> 00:19:49,750
Oh, don't panic.

666
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:52,333
If I know Rainbow Dash,

667
00:19:49,792 --> 00:19:52,333
she'll come through.

668
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,917
[door opens and closes]

669
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,250
[panting]

670
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,583
Spitfire, you're back! I

671
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,583
can't believe you made it!

672
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:04,417
Oh, I wouldn't have, if Rainbow

673
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:04,417
hadn't found me so fast.

674
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,750
Gave me enough time to fly back!

675
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,250
Rare, I couldn't have

676
00:20:06,792 --> 00:20:09,250
done it without you.

677
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,291
And I'm sorry

678
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,291
I doubted you.

679
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,583
But why didn't you tell

680
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,583
me what you were doing?

681
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,417
Well, I didn't want to get your

682
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,417
hopes up until I was sure.

683
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,959
And I couldn't be sure until

684
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,959
I saw that chocolate stain.

685
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,834
Thank you for believing in me...

686
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,875
...even when I was doubting

687
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:24,875
you. I'm some friend, huh?

688
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,792
Actually, you're

689
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:26,792
quite a good friend.

690
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:28,125
You went to get Spitfire,

691
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,500
even though it meant

692
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,500
you couldn't fly today.

693
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,375
[sigh] I'll get

694
00:20:30,542 --> 00:20:33,375
my chance one day.

695
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:37,375
Or today. How'd you like Wind

696
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:37,375
Rider's spot in the show?

697
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:41,375
What? You can't

698
00:20:37,417 --> 00:20:41,375
do this to me.

699
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:44,333
I'm one of the greatest

700
00:20:41,417 --> 00:20:44,333
Wonderbolts there ever was!

701
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,792
Not anymore. For attempting

702
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:47,792
to frame Rainbow Dash,

703
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,959
I hereby strip you of

704
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:50,959
your Wonderbolt status!

705
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,250
So would you like

706
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:56,250
to fly with us?

707
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:00,542
Would I? Woo-hoo!

708
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:00,542
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah!

709
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,291
Uh-huh, Uh-huh!

710
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:03,291
Yeah! Oh, YEAH!

711
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,834
Uh, Rainbow Dash?

712
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:06,834
[sheepish]

713
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:07,750
Coming!

714
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,542
<i>Rarity: So my friend got</i>

Stormy Flare:

That's nice, dear.

723
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,959
Oh. Did I say

724
00:21:25,667 --> 00:21:27,959
that out loud?
