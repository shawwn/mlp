I represent the Element of Magic

581
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:22,333
without these five.

582
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,125
And I certainly wouldn't

583
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,125
be here to stop you now.

584
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,250
Spare me your

585
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,250
sentimental nonsense.

586
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,417
I gave these ponies

587
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:29,417
real friendships

588
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,250
they never could

589
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,250
have had otherwise!

590
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,834
Double Diamond:

591
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:32,834
How do you know that?

592
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,041
You never even gave us a chance.

593
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,083
[explosion]

594
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,291
She's getting away!

595
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,291
We'll never find her in there.

596
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,709
We just have to hope that

597
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,709
when she's had a chance

598
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,166
to think it over,

599
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,083
she realizes that you all

600
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,083
have taught her something.

601
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,041
It's you who have

602
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:54,041
taught us something.

603
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,458
We all came to this village

604
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,458
because we were searching

605
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,625
for something missing

606
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,625
from our lives.

607
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:02,166
We thought Starlight had

608
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:02,166
given it to us, but now...

609
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,083
...now it seems it was

610
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:05,083
in front of us all along.

611
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:06,333
It's us.

612
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,750
Does that mean you'll

613
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,750
stay in the village?

614
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,125
It's our home.

615
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,291
I'm not going anywhere.

616
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,458
This is a chance for all of us

617
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:17,458
to get to know each other again

618
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,667
for the very first time.

619
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,959
And I finally have a

620
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:21,959
chance to bake something

621
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
besides terrible muffins!

622
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:28,542
[laughter]

623
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:35,583
[happy chatter]

624
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,500
Now those are real smiles.

625
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,041
I'll never get used to that.

626
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,417
I think it's divine.

627
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,834
Does that mean the map is

628
00:20:48,458 --> 00:20:51,834
calling us somewhere else?

629
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,792
I have a feeling it means

630
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:54,792
our work here is done.

631
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,458
Applejack: Looks like you

632
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:56,458
were right, Twilight.

633
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,041
The map did have a reason

634
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,041
for sendin' us here.

635
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,709
We brought real friendship

636
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,709
to these here ponies.

637
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,667
Guess that's why you're the

638
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,667
Princess of Friendship.

639
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:06,625
But the map didn't send me.

640
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:08,166
It sent us.

641
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:10,291
You're a part of me, all of you,

642
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,542
and there's no doubt you're

643
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,542
a part of my mission

644
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,166
to spread friendship, too.

645
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,625
[happy chatter]

646
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,166
This feels like an ending.

647
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,125
It doesn't have to be

648
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,125
an ending yet, right?

649
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,917
'Cause that Sugar

650
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,917
Belle can bake.

651
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:25,375
Maybe we can stay a

652
00:21:22,959 --> 00:21:25,375
little while longer.

653
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:27,417
Come on!
