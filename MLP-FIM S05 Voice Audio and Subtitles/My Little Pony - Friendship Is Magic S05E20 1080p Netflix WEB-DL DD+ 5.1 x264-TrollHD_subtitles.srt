00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,917
Pinkie: Five hundred

00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,917
and sixty-six,

3
00:00:04,959 --> 00:00:07,291
five hundred and sixty-seven...

4
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:08,542
five hundred and sixty-eight!

5
00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,166
Phew!

6
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,375
Look at that, Pound Cake.

7
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:21,125
I am so close to breaking my

8
00:00:16,417 --> 00:00:21,125
personal cupcake icing record!

9
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,750
My goodness! I can't believe

10
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,750
what I'm seeing here!

11
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,542
Pretty impressive,

12
00:00:24,792 --> 00:00:28,542
if I do say so myself.

13
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,291
Pinkie, would you mind

14
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:30,291
watching the counter

15
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,000
while I pop to the supply room?

16
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,542
We've just received

17
00:00:32,041 --> 00:00:34,542
a very special order

18
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,250
and the ingredients

19
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:37,250
need to be perfect.

20
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:38,750
Okie-dokie-lokie.

21
00:00:38,792 --> 00:00:39,792
Thanks, dear!

22
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,291

00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,959
Cadance are having A BABY?

26
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,667
This is the best news ever! I

27
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,667
can't wait to tell Twilight!

28
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:02,291
Oh, and Pinkie? Uh, it's

29
00:00:58,542 --> 00:01:02,291
a Top Secret surprise!

30
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:07,709
Shhhhhhhh!

31
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:10,709
A Top Secret Surprise?

32
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,417
But that means I have to keep

33
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:14,417

I can't tell Twilight

or anypony the big news.

62

from Pound Cake again?

67

Don't you know it's wrong

68
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,000
to steal from a baby?

00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,333
about a baby?

something about a baby?

73
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:24,000
You did, Miss Pie. Just now.

74
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:24,000
What were you talking about?

Great, everypony's here!

00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,375
Now I don't have

78
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,375
to wait any longer

00:02:44,417 --> 00:02:45,875

coming to visit Ponyville!

83
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,709
And I need your help

84
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:50,709
getting everything ready.

[Both at once] Shining

88
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,500
Armor and Princess Cadance!

89
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:02,333
Yes, and they're coming--

90
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:03,500
Tomorrow!

91
00:03:07,792 --> 00:03:09,291
Yes, on the--

92
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,417
Friendship Express rather

93
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,417
than the Crystal Empire train

94
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,333
so as not to cause

95
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,333
too much of a scene

96
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,792
when they skip

97
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,792
town to come visit?

98
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:15,625
Yes.

99
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:17,834
Aaaaaand?

100
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,166
And that's it.

101
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,166
Oh.

102
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,041
Uh, how did you

103
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:24,041
know all that?

104
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:27,375
Hehe, heh, uh... Pinkie sense?

105
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,750
So, you said you needed

106
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,750
our help with something?

107
00:03:32,792 --> 00:03:33,709
Follow me.

108
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,875
Sweet posters! Is

109
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,875
that Smash Fortune?

110
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,333
It sure is.

111
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,041
When Shining Armor said he

112
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,041
wanted to come to the castle

113
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,250
and visit, I started

114
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:48,250
collecting things he liked

115
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,875
when he was a colt

116
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:49,875
as a surprise.

117
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:53,583
Surprise? [nervous giggle]

118
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,792
I've been so excited that it's

119
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,792
been hard to keep it to myself.

120
00:03:58,834 --> 00:04:01,458
I have no idea what that's like.

121
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,792
Aww, look at the

122
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:04,792
cute little ant farm.

[screams]

124
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,750
And check out all

125
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,750
these old comic books!

126
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,458
Be careful; they're

127
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,458
mint in bag.

00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,583

[casual whistling]

130
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:22,750
What's this?

131
00:04:22,792 --> 00:04:24,583
This is Brutus Force!

132
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,500
Shining Armor used to carry

133
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:28,500
him around like his baby.

134
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:33,000
Yeah, ha ha, really

135
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:33,000
cute, [forced laughter]

136
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,125
It is a bit juvenile

137
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:36,125
for castle decor,

138
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:37,625
but it is very sweet of you.

139
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,583
I'm sure Shining

140
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,583
Armor will love it.

141
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,917
Me too. But, there's a few

142
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,917
more things I'd like to add

143
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,166
before he gets here

144
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,917
and I could really use

145
00:04:44,208 --> 00:04:45,917
a hoof collecting them.

146
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,667
Whatever you need, sugar

147
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:48,667
cube, we'll help Yeah get it.

148
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:50,542
[agreement]

149
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,041
Thanks, everypony.

150
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,458
I just can't wait till they

151
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,458
walk in and see everything!

152
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,834
Totally understandable. Watching

153
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,834
somepony else be surprised

154
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,208
with something is almost

155
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,208
better than being the one

156
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,750
who's getting the surprise!

157
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:06,000
But what if the surprise is

158
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:06,000
something so incredibly exciting

159
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,834
that a pony can't

160
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,834
keep it in any longer

161
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,500
and she has to tell the pony

162
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,500
who's standing next to her

163
00:05:09,542 --> 00:05:11,750
what it is or she might explode?

164
00:05:12,834 --> 00:05:15,500
I would say... no.

165
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:19,417
The pony who ruins a

166
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:19,417
surprise for somepony else

167
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:23,417
has to live with that

168
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:23,417
guilt... FOREVER!

169
00:05:23,458 --> 00:05:26,583
[nervous laugh] Gotta bounce!

[pinball bumper bells clanging]

171
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,291
So, I know the bar

172
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,291
is set pretty high...

173
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,291
but does anypony

174
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,291
else think Pinkie Pie

175
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:38,250
was acting weirder than usual?

176
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,542
[zoom]

177
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,875
[panting] Phew! That

178
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:47,875
was close! Too close.

179
00:05:47,917 --> 00:05:49,166
I almost spilled the beans.

180
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,834
Beans that would be

181
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,834
really hard to clean up.

182
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,458
I obviously can't be around

183
00:05:51,875 --> 00:05:54,458
my friends right now...

184
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,542
or anypony for that matter.

185
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,208
Hmm. That's it! If

186
00:05:56,583 --> 00:06:00,208
Shining Armor and Cadance

187
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,750
are coming tomorrow, then all

188
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:02,750
I have to do is lock myself

189
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,125
in my room away from

190
00:06:02,792 --> 00:06:05,125
everypony until they arrive.

191
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,166
Then I won't ruin anything!

192
00:06:07,208 --> 00:06:09,417
Oh, good. You're back.

193
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,709
Mrs. Cake needs my help but

194

friends. Tell, tell, tell.

386
00:13:54,583 --> 00:14:01,583
Friends, friends,

387
00:13:54,583 --> 00:14:01,583
friends. Tell, tell, tell.

388
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:06,417
OK! OK! You win!

389
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,250
SHINING ARMOR AND CADANCE

390
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,250
ARE GOING TO HAVE A--

391
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,458
... an awesome weekend

392
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,458
with the best little sister

393
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,834
in all of Equestria!

394
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:16,625
[giggles] Hi, everypony.

395
00:14:16,667 --> 00:14:18,250
[sighs heavily]

396
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,917
Shining Armor!

397
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,917
Cadance! You're early!

398
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,250
I thought something had come up

399
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,083
and you weren't going to

400
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,083
make it until Saturday!

401
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,166
So did we. Turned out we

402
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:31,166
weren't needed in Maretonia

403
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:32,625
until next week.

404
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,709
And the summit we were

405
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,709
supposed to attend today

406
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,750
had to be

407
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,750
rescheduled so...

408
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,125
we got here even

409
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,125
sooner than planned.

410
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,417
Surprise!

411
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,834
It's wonderful to

412
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,834
see you all again.

413
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:47,709
[happy chatter]

414
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,291
I'm so glad you're here. I

415
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:51,291
have a big surprise for you!

416
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,500
Oh, yeah?

417
00:14:56,417 --> 00:15:03,000
[chatting excitedly]

418
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,959
Lucky we came

419
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,959
when we did, huh?

420
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,583
I'm guessing you saw the scroll

421
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,583
we sent to Mr. and Mrs. Cake.

422
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,625
Hey, I'm impressed you've

423
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,625
been able to keep our secret

424
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:11,667
this long.

425
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:12,917
So you're gonna

426
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:12,917
tell Twilight now?

427
00:15:14,542 --> 00:15:18,667
[chatting excitedly]

428
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,959
You're going to have to wait

429
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,959
just a little bit longer.

430
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,542
We have something

431
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,542
special planned.

432
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,542
It'll be worth it, I promise.

433
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,000
It'd better be.

434
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,083
So do ya think Shining

435
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,083
Armor liked his surprise?

436
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,625
Didn't you see him? He

437
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,625
couldn't stop raving about it!

438
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,709
Where did Shining Armor and

439
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,709
Cadance say they'd meet us?

440
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,417
I'm starving.

441
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,625
In the town square.

442
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,542
I wish they'd waited

443
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,542
to walk over with us,

444
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,959
but they said they had something

445
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:54,959
to take care of first.

446
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,417
They're going to have a lot

447
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,417
more to take care of soon.

448
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,291
What?

449
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,291
Nothing!

450
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:08,709
That's odd. Usually

451
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:08,709
they're quite punctual.

452
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,875
Ughhh, I need a hayburger

453
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,875
in my belly right now.

454
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,041
What's this?

455
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:18,500
[gasp]

456
00:16:18,542 --> 00:16:20,041
What does it say?

457
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,291
A scavenger hunt! Shining Armor

458
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,291
used to set these up for me

459
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,166
when I was a filly.

460
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,208
At the end, there was always

461
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,208
a big prize like a new book,

462
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,834
or several new books, or--

463
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,667
We get the picture!

464
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,667
You like books!

465
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,625
So what's the first clue?

466
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,166
I hope it's something

467
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:36,166
about eating lunch.

468
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,875
"You've got a scroll,

469
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,875
you're on a roll.

470
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,291
Why don't you take a peek, where

471
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:40,291
young ones spend their week?

472
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,125
A piece of paper will

473
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,125
continue this caper."

474
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:45,959
I've got it!

475
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,500
"Where the young ones

476
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,500
spend their week!"

477
00:16:48,542 --> 00:16:50,583
I'm not quite followin'...

478
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,250
[clanging bell]

479
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,583
It's the Ponyville Schoolhouse!

480
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,917
Good enough for me! Now

481
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,917
where's the next clue?

482
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,333
[sniffing]

483
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:03,750
Ah-choo!

484
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:08,500
EXTRA! EXTRA! Get your Ponyville

485
00:17:03,792 --> 00:17:08,500
News! Read it in the paper!

486
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,792
EXTRA! EXTRA! Get

487
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,792
your Ponyville...

488
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:13,208
"A piece of paper, will

489
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:13,208
continue this caper".

490
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,834
It's in the Foal Free Press!

491
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,458
Ooh! Look at that dress

492
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:23,458
Mayor Mare is wearing

493
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,834
in the social report.

494
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,834
Why, it's stunning!

495
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,208
Uh, didn't you make

496
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:29,208
that, Rarity?

497
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,041
Yes. What is your point?

498
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,041
FOCUS, EVERYPONY!

499
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,083
You know, there's

500
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:35,083
really no time limit

501
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,917
on these scavenger

502
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,917
hunts, Pinkie.

503
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:39,375
AHA! There!

504
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,083
"Though this hall

505
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:42,083
is rather small,

506
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,458
in it you'll find

507
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,458
files of all kinds.

508
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,000
Take a look on the back, of the

509
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,000
birth certificate of Applejack!"

510
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,417
I don't like where

511
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,417
this is goin'.

512
00:17:57,917 --> 00:18:00,208
[galloping hooves]

513
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:10,500
Baby! A ROYAL BAA---

514
00:18:10,542 --> 00:18:12,792
Ahem!

515
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,875
Does anypony know where the

516
00:18:12,834 --> 00:18:14,875
birth certificates are kept?

517
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,709
Ooo! I do! I do! Go down that

518
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,709
hall, then you take a left,

519
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,000
and then a right, then another

520
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,000
right, then a slight left,

521
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,792
then it's the third

522
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,792
door from the right.

523
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,917
Wow, Pinkie. I never knew you

524
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:25,917
knew so much about Town Hall.

525
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,583
There's a lot of

526
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,583
things I know...

527
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,250
that you don't know I know!

528
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:42,000
Oh, you're so

529
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:42,000
cute![giggling and cooing]

530
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,792
"This next place is where,

531
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,792
you can buy a table or chair.

532
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,250
Or some comfy beds to

533
00:18:45,834 --> 00:18:49,250
rest little heads."

534
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,875
Gah! Really? None of you?

535
00:18:55,917 --> 00:19:00,125
It's obviously the furniture

536
00:18:55,917 --> 00:19:00,125
store! Go in, go in, go in!

537
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:01,291
I don't know...

538
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,375
AHHHH! Fine.

539
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:06,792
[crashing]

540
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:15,041
Wow. You're scary good

541
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:15,041
at this, Pinkie Pie.

542
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,834
"It seems we've saved

543
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:16,834
the best for last,

544
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:17,709
we hope that you

545
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:17,709
have had a blast.

546
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,834
Now it's time to take a break,

547
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,458
where you can get

548
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,458
a slice of cake!"

549
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,709
Sugarcube Corner!

550
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,083
That was an easy one.

551
00:19:25,417 --> 00:19:27,625
[bell jingles]

552
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:32,542
Surprise! Twily! Did you

553
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:32,542
like the scavenger hunt?

554
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:34,083
It was perfect.

555
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,750
Just like old times, except

556
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:36,750
even better because this time

557
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,834
I got to share it

558
00:19:36,792 --> 00:19:38,834
with my best friends.

559
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,375
There's just one thing

560
00:19:41,208 --> 00:19:43,375
missing, isn't there?

561
00:19:43,417 --> 00:19:44,709
What's that?

562
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,792
The book prize at the end!

563
00:19:46,834 --> 00:19:49,458
[chuckle] There's still a prize.

564
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,709
But it's a little

565
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,709
different this time.

566
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,041
Oh. I don't understand.

567
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,542
Hee hee hee.

568
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:59,000
All the places we sent you

569
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:59,000
today had something in common.

570
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,083
First we went to

571
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:02,083
the schoolhouse...

572
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,834
...and then we read

573
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:06,834
the Foal Free Press.

574
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,083
After that we found Applejack's
