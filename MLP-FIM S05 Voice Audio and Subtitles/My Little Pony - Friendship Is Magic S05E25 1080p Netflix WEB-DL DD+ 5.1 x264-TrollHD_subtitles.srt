388
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,709
to set things right.

389
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:02,083
I hope you do.

390
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,875
So. How are we going

391
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:06,875
to set things right?

392
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,083
I DON'T KNOW!

393
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,125
The only thing we know for sure

394
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,375
is that Starlight

395
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,375
stopped the Rainboom.

396
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,542
And that the

397
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:16,542
map's still here.

398
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,083
Spike! That's it!

399
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,208
The map is connected to

400
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,208
the Tree of Harmony.

401
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,166
It must sense that

402
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,166
something isn't right.

403
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:24,291
That's why it's still here.

404
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,250
I'll just use Starlight's

405
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,250
version of the spell

406
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,792
and go back a little earlier

407
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,750
and stop her before she

408
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,750
even knows we're there!

409
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:36,959
[whoosh]

410
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:43,125
Aaaah!

411
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,542
All we have to do now is

412
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,542
find Starlight and st-

414
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,083
<i>Well, finding her</i>

415
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,083
<i>will be easy.</i>

416
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,458
But stopping her's going to

417
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:57,458
be harder than you think!

418
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,125
Sorry to disappoint you,

419
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,125
but I created that spell

420
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,667
to send myself back in time.

421
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:07,208
So even when you cast it, I

422
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:07,208
still get sent back here.

423
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,792
It wasn't difficult to

424
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,792
change Starswirl's spell;

425
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:11,625
he'd already done the hard part.

426
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:16,083
But figuring out I could use the

427
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:16,083
map to go to any time or place

428
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:17,875
and pull you along with me?

429
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,500
Ha ha! I even impressed

430
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,500
myself with that.

431
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,083
I knew you'd try to stop

432
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:26,083
me. You're so predictable.

433
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,333
Why else would I leave

434
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,333
the scroll behind?

435
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,083
Touching it triggered

436
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,083
the map to whisk you here

437
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,709
and watch me erase

438
00:16:31,083 --> 00:16:33,709
the one thing

439
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:36,542
that linked

440
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:36,542
you with your friends.

441
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:39,291
My village was a

442
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:39,291
sanctuary of equality

443
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,625
where no pony's cutie mark

444
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:42,625
allowed them to feel superior.

445
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:47,291
It was a special place, and you

446
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:47,291
and your friends took it away.

447
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,917
Now it's my turn to take

448
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,917
something special from you.

449
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:58,792
Without the Rainboom, you and

450
00:16:54,917 --> 00:16:58,792
your friends will never form

451
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:01,333
your special cutie mark bond.

452
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:05,875
Cutie marks for cutie marks.

453
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:05,875
Sounds like a fair trade to me.

454
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:27,208
Spike: Twilight!

455
00:17:27,208 --> 00:17:28,125
Whoops!

457
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:33,834
Thanks.

458
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:35,250
No problem, Spike.

459
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,750
At least now we know

460
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,750
exactly what we have to do.

461
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,083
OK. Keep your eyes peeled.

462
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,083
Right.

463
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:53,333
We have to stop Starlight

464
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,875
as soon as Rainbow Dash

465
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,875
and those bullies race by.

Um, Twilight...

00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,792
So be ready.

468
00:17:59,792 --> 00:18:00,834
I know, but...

469
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,542
Because she could

470
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:02,542
pop up anywhere.

471
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:05,208
Like over there?

472
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,583
Just remember

473
00:18:07,458 --> 00:18:09,583
how you'd feel

474
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,583
if someone said

475
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,583
those things to you.

476
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,625
What's going on here?

477
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,208
Oh, I was just reminding

478
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:17,208
these two colts

479
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,750
how hurtful teasing can be.

480
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,083
Well, don't!

481
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:22,625
Huh?

482
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,375
I mean... You were?

483
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:30,208
Of course. In a world where

484
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:30,208
every pony is unique,

485
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:34,166
some are bound to feel

486
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:34,166
more special than others.

487
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,792
But that isn't a licence

488
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:37,792
to be cruel is it?

489
00:18:37,792 --> 00:18:40,959
No. Of course not.

490
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:43,208
Isn't it a shame

491
00:18:40,959 --> 00:18:43,208
we don't live in a world

492
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:45,625
where everypony is equal.

493
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,959
No one would ever tease anyone

494
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:49,959

00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:51,500
Mm hm!

496
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,542
No. It wouldn't!

497
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,834
I mean, it'd be nice not

498
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,834
to be teased, of course,

499
00:18:56,834 --> 00:18:59,291

bullies to not tease Fluttershy

00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:14,583
to stop the Rainboom.

508
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,083
Oh, that's not true. I convinced

509
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:18,083
them not to be bullies

510
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,083
