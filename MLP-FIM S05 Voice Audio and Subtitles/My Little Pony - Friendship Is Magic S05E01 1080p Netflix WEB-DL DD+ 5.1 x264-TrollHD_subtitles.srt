00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,917
own unique Cutie Marks.

197
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:05,250
If you don't mind,

198
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,458
has there been any sort

199
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:08,458
of trouble here lately?

200
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Why, I don't think

201
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Trouble?

202
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,500
we've ever had trouble

203
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:12,959
in our little village.

204
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:13,875
It's true.

205
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:15,458
You'll see.

206
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,333
Perhaps you'd care to speak to

207
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,333
our founder, Starlight Glimmer.

208
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,834
I wish everypony in Equestria

209
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,625
was as friendly as

210
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,625
these ponies are.

211
00:07:24,667 --> 00:07:26,792
I've got my eye on them.

212
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:30,375
Something's rotten in...whatever

213
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:30,375
the name of this village is

214
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:32,458
that we're in right now.

215
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,250
[knock knock]

216
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:35,333
Starlight?

217
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,917
We have some new visitors!

218
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,834
Be ready to fight.

219
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,875
We don't know what's gonna

220
00:07:43,875 --> 00:07:45,875
come through that door.

221
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,792
Welcome!

222
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,291
I'm so pleased to

223
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:52,291
have you here.

224
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,375
[groan]

225
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:57,709
This is Applejack, Fluttershy,

226
00:07:54,417 --> 00:07:57,709
Pinkie Pie, Rarity,

227
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,375
Rainbow Dash, and

228
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,375
Twilight Sparkle.

229
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,583
Forgive my bluntness,

230
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,667
but I'm assuming it's

231
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,667
Princess Twilight Sparkle?

232
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,709
We don't get many

233
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:11,709
alicorns around here.

234
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,083
Yes. But Twilight is fine.

235
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,625
So! How did you hear

236
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,625
of our little village?

237
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,500
It's kind of a long story.

238
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,750
Let's just say we

239
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,750
found it on a map.

240
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,959
Technically it's a

241
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,959
tree-chest-castle-map.

242
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:31,417
Well, however you found us,

243
00:08:27,792 --> 00:08:31,417
we're happy to have you.

244
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,375
We're happy to have anypony

245
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:34,375
who wants to experience

246
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,875
true friendship for

247
00:08:34,417 --> 00:08:37,875
the first time.

248
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,458
Say what?

249
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,834
Oh, indeed.

250
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,291
That's what's so unique

251
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:43,291
about our village, you see.

252
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,291
Around here, we don't

253
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,291
flaunt our special talents

254
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,667
because we don't have any

255
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:49,667
special talents to flaunt.

256
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,458
Is that why you all

257
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:52,458
have those Cutie Marks?

258
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,083
Perhaps it would be

259
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,083
easier to understand

260
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,083
if I gave you a tour

261
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,083

You're kidding, right?

Give up our Cutie Marks?

324
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:26,542
No way!

325
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,875
Fluttershy: Rainbow Dash,

326
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,875
don't be so rude!

327
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,542
I don't think we

328
00:11:28,917 --> 00:11:30,542
should judge them.

329
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,458
They all seem perfectly

330
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:33,458
happy with their choice.

331
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,583
Don't believe their

332
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,583
smiles, Fluttershy.

333
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:40,417
I'm sorry, I guess we're just a

334
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:40,417
little confused by all of this.

335
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,333
We have no judgments

336
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:43,333
here in our village.

337
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,291
Each of us was

338
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,291
confused once as well,

339
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,625
blinded by the false

340
00:11:46,333 --> 00:11:49,625
promise of our Cutie Marks.

341
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,083
Whoa whoa whoa!

342
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,250
Is she for real?

343
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,083
When we were sent

344
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,083
to this village,

345
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,834
we assumed it was to help

346
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:58,834
in some way, but...well,

347
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,291
it doesn't seem like

348
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,291
you need any help.

349
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:05,083
Have you considered perhaps that

350
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:05,083
you might have been sent here

351
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,250
so we could help you?

352
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,208
After all, nopony has

353
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,208
ever come to our village

354
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:13,625
and wanted to leave.

355
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:16,458
Why should you be any different?

356
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,250
But that is entirely

357
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,250
your choice.

358
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:23,166
Please, enjoy our little

359
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:23,166
corner of Equestria.

360
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,709
We're all quite fond of it.

361
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,458
No doubt you will be as well.

362
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,250
Double Diamond, please

363
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,250
help our guests

364
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,917
with whatever they

365
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,917
might need.

366
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,083
Of course.

367
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,583
Well, this will certainly

368
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:40,583
provide a boost

369
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,875
to our little community.

370
00:12:42,917 --> 00:12:44,542
When the rest of Equestria sees

371
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,083
that a princess gave up

372
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:48,083
her Cutie Mark to join us,

373
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,834
they'll finally understand what

374
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,834
we're trying to accomplish.

375
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,333
Welcome!

376
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,583
Welcome!

377
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,750
Welcome!

378
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,500
A Cutie Mark is

379
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,500
a representation

380
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,500
of a pony's unique

381
00:13:01,542 --> 00:13:03,500
talents and skills.

382
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:04,875
How is it possible to--

383
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,959
[gasp] What in the name

384
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,959
of Equestria is THAT?

385
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,083
Welcome!

386
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,125
Care to sample

387
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,125
some local fashion?

388
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,458
We've got cloaks this month!

389
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,083
[gag]

390
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:22,083
Perhaps another time,

391
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:22,083
good sir, thank you.

392
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,083
No wonder nopony's

393
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:28,083
wearing anything.

394
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,375
Really, girls, they may do

395
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,375
things a bit differently

396
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,375
than we're used to, but that's

397
00:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,375
no reason to be rude!

398
00:13:33,417 --> 00:13:36,083
No, the reason to be rude

399
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,208
is that they all

400
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:37,208
keep staring at us.

401
00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:40,709
Need something?

402
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,125
Uh, no, we're good.

403
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,125
Fluttershy's right.

404
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,917
If we're going to

405
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,917
get to the bottom

406
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:47,458
of why the map sent us here,

407
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,333
we'll need the

408
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,333
help of these ponies.

409
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,542
I think we ran off to

410
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,542
the end of Equestria

411
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,583
before we even knew

412
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:53,583
what that map was!

413
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,333
If we were at the

414
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,333
end of Equestria,

415
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,542
we'd be sitting on

416
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,542
a big A!

417
00:13:57,583 --> 00:13:59,083
Hee Hee! Get it?

418
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,083
Oh please, Miss Pie, this is

419
00:13:59,083 --> 00:14:02,083
hardly the time for jokes.

420
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,417
We've come all this

421
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:04,417
way and for what?

422
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,083
Maybe you're right,

423
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,083
but we're here now.

424
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,500
And it sure feels like

425
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:09,500
something's wrong.

426
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,750
That and two bits'll

427
00:14:09,542 --> 00:14:11,750
get you a cup of cider.

428
00:14:11,792 --> 00:14:13,625
Is this a bad time?

429
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,083
We shouldn't be

430
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:15,083
bickering like this

431
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,500
in front of our

432
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,500
new friends.

433
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,750
Really, Applejack, you're

434
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,750
almost as bad as Rainbow Dash!

435
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,458
Don't drag me

436
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,458
into this.

437
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:25,083
Is your friendship ending?

438
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,458
Are you crazy?

439
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,458
We'd never let a disagreement

440
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,458
get in the way of food!

441
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,667
OK, well. My

442
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,667
name is Sugar Belle.

443
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,291
What can I bring you?

444
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,917
We have muffins...

445
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:45,083
Then I guess we'll

446
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:45,083
take six muffins.

447
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,667
Make that twelve.

448
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:48,875
What? I'm hungry.

449
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,625
Come on, girls, we've

450
00:14:48,917 --> 00:14:51,625
got to stick together.

451
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:55,208
It doesn't matter what happened

452
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:55,208
before; we're here now.

453
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,917
I guess you're right.

454
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,333
And the sooner we figure out

455
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,333
why, the sooner we can go home.

456
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,875
Forgive me for

457
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,875
overhearing,

458
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:05,750
but just a moment ago

459
00:15:02,917 --> 00:15:05,750
you were disagreeing.

460
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:08,667
And now it sounds

461
00:15:05,792 --> 00:15:08,667
like you're agreeing.

462
00:15:08,709 --> 00:15:10,375
Uh-huh.

463
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,583
Well, you had such

464
00:15:10,417 --> 00:15:12,583
differing opinions.

465
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,959
And Cutie Marks.

466
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,333
We have differing opinions

467
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:17,333
all the time, darling.

468
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,834
But you look like

469
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,834
you're friends.

470
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,083
We are friends.

471
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,375
A simple disagreement

472
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:22,375
wouldn't change that.

473
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:29,125
I'm sorry, I'm just having

474
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:29,125
a hard time understanding.

475
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,291
Different talents lead

476
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:30,291
to different opinions,

477
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,458
which lead to

478
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,458
bitterness and misery.

479
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,959
So, why aren't you

480
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,959
bitter and--

481
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,667
Peh!

482
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:38,458
Blech!

483
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,875
Mmm...good!

484
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:45,959
It's all right, I know

485
00:15:42,917 --> 00:15:45,959
I'm not a very good baker.

486
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,667
At least, I'm not any

487
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,667
better than anypony else

488
00:15:48,709 --> 00:15:50,709
in the village.

489
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:55,625
Well, I hope you enjoy

490
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:55,625
our little village!

491
00:15:57,166 --> 00:15:58,625
Come inside before you go.

492
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,500
Meet me downstairs.

493
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,083
OK, that was weird, too.

494
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,291
Let's all sit here and eat

495
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,291
these muffins and act normal.

496
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,333
I think we're being watched.

497
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,291
Ya think?

498
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:19,834
No, not like that.

499
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,834
I mean somepony here doesn't

500
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,834
want us talking to Sugar Belle.

501
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,875
I got an idea.

502
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,917
But you gotta eat all

503
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:30,917
them muffins, Pinkie.

504
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,125
Me? Why me?

505
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,917
You got a stronger

506
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,917
stomach than any of us

507
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,834
and that filly in there

508
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,834
might be our best chance

509
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,959
at findin' out what in the

510
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,959
hay is goin' on around here.

511
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:56,709
Applejack: I can't believe you

512
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:56,709
ate all our muffins, Pinkie Pie!

513
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,667
We'd best go inside

514
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:00,667
and get some more!

515
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:02,792
Nice work, Pinkie.

516
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:09,875
I've accidentally eaten

517
00:17:05,542 --> 00:17:09,875
cardboard tastier than that.

518
00:17:09,917 --> 00:17:12,458
Hello? Sugar Belle?

519
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,792
Sugar Belle: Thank

520
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,792
you for coming.

521
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,291
Why did want us

522
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:18,291
to come down here?

523
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,083
So nopony could see

524
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,083
what's about to happen.

525
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:27,375
<i>♪ [eerie] ♪</i>

526
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:30,667
Are you really the

527
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:30,667
Princess of Friendship?

528
00:17:30,709 --> 00:17:32,333
Do you know Princess Celestia?

529
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,875
I love your Cutie Mark!

530
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:37,291
How can you be friends with

531
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:37,291
different Cutie Marks?

532
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,083
Don't you end up

533
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:39,083
hating each other?

534
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,542
Oh, look at this one!

535
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,542
This one's great too!

536
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,458
I'd love to have my

537
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,458
special talent back,

538
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,417
even just for a day...make

539
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,417
something besides those

540
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,500
disgusting muffins.

541
00:17:49,542 --> 00:17:51,083
So what's stopping you?

542
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,959
Go get your Cutie

543
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,959
Marks back.

544
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,375
Daydreaming is one

545
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,375
thing, but you mean...

546
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:57,792
actually having

547
00:17:55,417 --> 00:17:57,792
it put back on?

548
00:17:57,834 --> 00:17:59,917
That seems extreme.

549
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,291
I'm not sure Starlight

550
00:18:01,083 --> 00:18:03,291
would like that.

551
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,083
She wants us all to be

552
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:06,083
happy in our sameness.

553
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,125
How do you take somepony's

554
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:09,125
Cutie Mark, anyway?

555
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:13,083
The Cutie Unmarking is

556
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:13,083
a beautiful experience.

557
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,417
Starlight uses the

558
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,417
Staff of Sameness

559
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,417
to magically take them away

560
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:19,417
and replace them with these.

561
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:23,083
But nopony should keep

562
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:23,083
you from your Cutie Mark.

563
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,917
It represents such an

564
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,917
essential part of who you are!

565
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,709
Oh, we're not kept from them.

566
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,875
They're in the vault,

567
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,875
up in the caves.

568
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:32,083
We can visit them any time

569
00:18:29,917 --> 00:18:32,083
we like to remind us

570
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:36,083
of the heartache of a life

571
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:36,083
with special talents.

572
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,875
Can we visit this cave?

573
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,083
I'm delighted you're interested

574
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,083
in our Cutie Mark vault!

575
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,417
We hope someday every pony in

576
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,417
Equestria will make a pilgrimage

577
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:53,917
here to our little village

578
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:53,917
to have theirs removed, too,

579
00:18:53,959 --> 00:18:55,375
[continues]

580
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,125
This must be the

581
00:18:55,417 --> 00:18:57,125
reason we're here.

582
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,542
Pilgrimaging?

583
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,417
No, helping those ponies

584
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,417
get their Cutie Marks back.

585
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,875
Oh. Are you sure, Twilight?

586
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,417
Maybe they missed

587
00:19:03,917 --> 00:19:05,417
them a little,

588
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,875
but even they didn't

589
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,875
seem all that unhappy.

590
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,166
Then why did they want

591
00:19:07,917 --> 00:19:10,166
to meet us in secret?

592
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,375
And why did they ask us

593
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,375
not to tell Starlight

594
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:13,834
who told us about the vault?

595
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,875
Something's not right.

596
00:19:15,917 --> 00:19:17,959
Just through here!

597
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,500
Behold!

598
00:19:25,959 --> 00:19:28,500
Our Cutie Mark vault.

599
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:34,625
Twilight: I've never seen

600
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:34,625
anything like it!

601
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:38,709
And here is the

602
00:19:34,667 --> 00:19:38,709
Staff of Sameness.

603
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,125
It was one of the great

604
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,125
mage Meadowbrook's

605
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:43,208
nine enchanted items.

606
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,208
We are incredibly

607
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:46,208
fortunate to have it here.

608
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,333
This is the tool that allows

609
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,333
us to free ourselves

610
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,458
from our Marks.

611
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,458
I'm curious; how did the

612
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:56,458
subject of the vault come up?

613
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,083
Oh, some ponies

614
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,083
were telling us

615
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,834
how much they missed

616
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,834
their Cutie Marks and--

617
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:00,875
Pinkie!

618
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,000
Oops.

619
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,125
Starlight: Were they!

620
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:08,291
Well, it seems you inspire

621
00:20:04,166 --> 00:20:08,291
all sorts of free thinking,

622
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,959
don't you?

623
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,834
We certainly didn't intend to

624
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,834

Good.

of that, shall we?

630
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:23,750
