00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:19,667
about the best weekend ever!

195
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:22,041
He's everywhere

196
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:22,041
today, isn't he?

197
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,625
Oh, now where was I?

198
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:28,709
Ah, yes, we'd just finished our

199
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:28,709
soup and then Applejack said,

200
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,458
"Peanut butter hoof? Yuck!

201
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:33,458
Not even with jelly."

202
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,458
[laughter]

203
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,083
I don't get it.

204
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,792
It was hilarious. I wish we'd

205
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:42,792
taken a picture for you.

206
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,625
Discord: Oh, well

207
00:06:42,834 --> 00:06:44,625
this should do.

208
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:47,625
[clattering]

209
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:52,417
[hysterical laughter]

210
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:54,834
I guess that's funny?

211
00:06:54,875 --> 00:07:00,667
Well, seems this has become

212
00:06:54,875 --> 00:07:00,667
quite the sticky situation.

213
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:04,917
HA! Sticky situation!

214
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,709
Aw shucks, Twilight,

215
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,917
we haven't even asked

216
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,917
how your weekend went.

217
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,000
It was fine.

218
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,709
And yet you look so glum.

219
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,542
Does somepony need

220
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:16,542
a huggy-wuggy?

221
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:20,375
Whoooo.

222
00:07:20,417 --> 00:07:23,000
I am not glum. I'm glad.

223
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,417
I'm glad you all had such

224
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,417
a good time together.

225
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,667
Having inside jokes can

226
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,667
really create a lasting bond

227
00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:29,208
between friends.

228
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,792
I'm just sorry that all

229
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,792
this bonding happened

230
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,750
while you were holed

231
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:34,750
up in your castle.

232
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:37,750
Oh, don't you worry

233
00:07:34,792 --> 00:07:37,750
'bout Twilight.

234
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,709
Bet you were in hog heaven

235
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,709
organizin' all them books.

236
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,542
Again.

237
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,458
I'm sure I had just as much

238
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:45,458
fun as the rest of you.

239
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:50,959
I can't believe I missed

240
00:07:47,542 --> 00:07:50,959
out on all that bonding.

241
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,125
I knew it! You

242
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,125
<i>are</i> jealous!

243
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:57,458
Spike, I'm the Princess of

244
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:57,458
Friendship. I don't get jealous.

245
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,875
I'm sorry I missed out because

246
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,875
sharing that experience

247
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,166
would have helped me with my

248
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,166
Princess of Friendship duties.

249
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:05,333
Come again?

250
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,375
If our friends could enjoy

251
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,375
three full days with Discord

252
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,417
that much, it must have

253
00:08:07,417 --> 00:08:09,417
something to do with

254
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,667
the specific things

255
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:11,667
they did together.

256
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,333
If we could find out

257
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,333
what those things were,

258
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,250
it could be a real breakthrough

259
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,250
in the science of friendship.

260
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,917
I guess so.

261
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,500
I know so! You thought our

262
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,500
booksortcation was fun?

263
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,166
This is going to be

264
00:08:22,542 --> 00:08:25,166
even better!

265
00:08:29,583 --> 00:08:31,000
Thank you for coming.

266
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,250
I wouldn't have asked you

267
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,250
here if it wasn't important.

268
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,250
I love important!

269
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:39,125
I want to know how these "funny"

270
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:39,125
moments you shared came to pass.

271
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,291
I can use this data to

272
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,291
help advance friendships

273
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,041
all over Equestria.

274
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,583
Well, I like the sound of that.

275
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,917
[agreement]

276
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,250
Perfect. Let's start

277
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,250
with, "The Snake."

278
00:08:52,417 --> 00:08:55,417
[raucous laughter]

279
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,458
I don't know if I can get

280
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,458
it out! It's too funny!

281
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,709
Oh, but we must. It's

282
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,709
for the greater good.

283
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,875
It started when we were helping

284
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,875
Granny Smith with her garden.

285
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:10,375
Uh, I reckon you mean

286
00:09:06,917 --> 00:09:10,375
my sister, Apple Bloom.

287
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,417
Oh. All you Apples

288
00:09:10,417 --> 00:09:13,417
look the same.

289
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,750
And then Rainbow

290
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:16,750
Dash saw a snake.

291
00:09:16,792 --> 00:09:19,166
I think it was a garden hose.

292
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,041
It was a "Hose

293
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,041
Snake." Super Deadly.

294
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:24,333
I recall it being a large stick

295
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,792
that looked like a hose

296
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,792
that in turn did in fact

297
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,333
resemble a snake.

298
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:30,542
Point is WE galloped away!

299
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,667
And it chased after us!

300
00:09:32,709 --> 00:09:34,917
The hose? A snake? A stick?

301
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:35,750
A snake!

302
00:09:35,792 --> 00:09:36,583
A hose!

303
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:38,083
A stick!

304
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:42,166
We literally trotted for our

305
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:42,166
lives. Isn't that hilarious?

306
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,709
I guess you had to be there.

307
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,417
I DO need to be there.

308
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:47,834
But you weren't.

309
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,250
And it's already happened.

310
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:51,250
Oooh. Are you suggesting--

311
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,917
Time Travel?

312
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,750
Absolutely not! Time travel is

313
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:57,750
not something to be messed with.

314
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,583
We simply need to

315
00:09:57,792 --> 00:09:59,583
recreate everything

316
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,500
that led to these jokes.

317
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:04,542
Oh! What a brilliant idea!

318
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,083
Shall we begin with the

319
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,083
lunch date that kicked off

320
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,333
the glorious weekend

321
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:10,333
you missed out on?

322
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:14,875
Are you sure it was this table?

323
00:10:14,917 --> 00:10:16,709
Uh, does it really matter?

324
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
When it comes to science,

325
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,000
everything matters.

326
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,875
One change to the equation

327
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:21,875
could ruin the experiment.

328
00:10:21,917 --> 00:10:25,667
Ohhhhh. It was this table here.

329
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:31,417
♪♪

330
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,417
All right, so you

331
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,417
sat down at the table

332
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,583
and then what happened?

333
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,208
Oh, well first, I

334
00:10:34,625 --> 00:10:36,208
expressed my displeasure

335
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,041
with the design

336
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,041
of the menu and--

337
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,917
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt, but

338
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,917
I've just noticed something.

339
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:42,250
Yes?

340
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,875
The tablecloth. It

341
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,875
isn't the same color

342
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:47,333
as the one the restaurant

343
00:10:44,917 --> 00:10:47,333
used on the day in question.

344
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,125
Really?

345
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,125
He's right. The

346
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:53,125
tablecloth was red.

347
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,917
I remember because it clashed

348
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:55,917
with the font on the menus.

349
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,667
I don't suppose that

350
00:10:55,959 --> 00:10:57,667
means we're gonna need

351
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,375
to get a new

352
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,375
tablecloth, does it?

353
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,625
Oh, most definitely.

354
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,125
Wow!

355
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:10,000
One change to the equation

356
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:10,000
could ruin the experiment.

357
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,709
Twilight said so herself.

358
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:18,333
Anything stand out as being

359
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:18,333
different? Anything at all?

360
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,834
Um, I've noticed a

361
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,834
couple of things.

362
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:21,917
Me, too!

363
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:23,250
Excellent.

364
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:30,166
Discord: A little to the left...

365
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,000
no, my left...

366
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:33,250
a little bit more...

367
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,625
oh no, no, no, a

368
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,625
little more right.

369
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,667
The cloud over our table looked

370
00:11:35,667 --> 00:11:38,667
like an ice cream sundae.

371
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,291
Perfect.

372
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,166
No. No. No. No. No. This is

373
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:53,166
barely room temperature.

374
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,208
Garcon! Garcon, over here.

375
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:05,000
[laughter]

376
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,625
No? Nothing?

377
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:10,083
Are you sure there's not

378
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:10,083
something you've missed?

379
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,291
Some other detail about

380
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,291
your lunch together

381
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,458
that you're forgetting?

382
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,291
Well, I don't know

383
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,291
about the rest of you,

384
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,500
but I feel we've been pretty

385

393
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,792
But it is really important

394
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,792
that I figure this out.

00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,583
Well, perhaps we should

398
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,583
have another look

399
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:38,083

[gasp] Of course!

00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,959
There is one last variable

402
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:43,959
that we haven't accounted for.

403

You weren't there observing us.

No matter how hard we try,

411

But I can't figure it out.

Ahh, a friendship with

Discord is truly a shock

what you thought was fun

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,166
You were all there but--

578
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,417
[sigh]

579
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:57,125
I wasn't there. I missed out.

580
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,000
And seeing you having all

581
00:17:57,166 --> 00:18:00,000
these jokes I wasn't a part of

582
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,125
and couldn't

583
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,125
understand made me...

584
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,500
Jealous?

585
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:07,375
No. The Princess of

586
00:18:03,542 --> 00:18:07,375
Friendship can't get jealous.

587
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:11,959
Sure you can, Twilight. And

588
00:18:07,417 --> 00:18:11,959
none of us begrudge you for it.

589
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,333
We're sorry if we made

590
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,333
you feel left out.

591
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,333
You didn't do anything wrong.

592
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,625
You're allowed to share

593
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:20,625
things that don't include me.

594
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,458
And you're allowed to feel

595
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,458
a little jealous about it.

596
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,208
You just have to be able to

597
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,208
admit that's what you're feeling

598
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,041
so you can let it go.

599
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,792
And, you know, not try to

600
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:30,792
make us recreate everything

601
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,250
that happened when

602
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:33,250
you weren't around.

603
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,250
Of course, none of this

604
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,250
would have happened

605
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:40,375
if I hadn't encouraged everypony

606
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:40,375
not to invite you this weekend.

607
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,750
They wanted me to be there?

608
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,542
And you convinced

609
00:18:42,792 --> 00:18:45,542
them to not invite me?

610
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,959
Well, I didn't think that

611
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,959
they should interrupt you.

612
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,166
But now I see that we should

613
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,166
have. Oh, I feel just terrible.

614
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,291
You don't look like

615
00:18:55,709 --> 00:18:58,291
you feel terrible.

616
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,458
Better?

617
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,125
Applejack: Wait a minute.

618
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,208
You didn't suggest

619
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,208
not inviting Twilight

620
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,583
cause you wanted to make

621
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,583
her feel left out, did you?

622
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,000
Of course not!

623
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,834
That whole jealousy thing

624
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,834
was just a happy accident.

625
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,750
Certainly we can all agree

626
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,750
that Princess Twilight

627
00:19:16,792 --> 00:19:18,917
learned a valuable lesson here.

628
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:22,417
That even she can have

629
00:19:18,959 --> 00:19:22,417
feelings of jealousy.

630
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,500
That she should

631
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:24,500
recognize said feelings

632
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:29,625
rather than try to pretend

633
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:29,625
that she doesn't have them?

634
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,709
Did I get the tiniest bit

635
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:31,709
of glee out of watching her

636
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,875
try to recreate our weekend of

637
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,875
fun in the name of "science"?

638
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:39,583
Oh, most definitely.

639
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,542
But what's important here is

640
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:43,542
that it was never my intent

641
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,208
to make Twilight feel jealous.

642
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,709
That's something the old

643
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,709
me would have tried to do.

644
00:19:50,917 --> 00:19:53,542
Orange you glad I've changed?

645
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,834
I said "Orange you

646
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:02,834
glad I've changed?"

647
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,208
[clattering]

648
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,583
[cough]

649
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,208
Orange! Like the ones

650
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:10,208
at the Applejack farm.

651
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,667
From this weekend.

652
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:16,458
No? Nothing? Really?

653
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,625
I thought you'd find

654
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,625
this hisss-sterical.

655
00:20:19,667 --> 00:20:22,208
[rattle]

656
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,000
Yes, no. Discord, I think these

657
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:27,000
jokes have run their course.

658
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,792
Only way we'd find

659
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,792
them funny now is

660
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,500
if you put us all under

661
00:20:28,834 --> 00:20:31,500
some kind of spell.

662
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:34,417
Come on! You'd have to

663
00:20:31,542 --> 00:20:34,417
be a complete crazy pony

664
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,375
to think he'd do

665
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,375
something like that.

666
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,208
What are you going

667
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,208
to say next, Pinkie?

668
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,041
That we'd all have to drink some

669
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,041
weird potion to break the spell?

670
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:43,750
[laughter]

671
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:46,041
What's so funny?

672
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:50,875
Come on, Discord, do we really

673
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:50,875
have to spell it out for you?

674
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:56,625
[laughter]

675
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:58,083
I don't get it.

676
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:02,667
Somepony want to tell me

677
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:02,667
what's so hilarious? Anypony?

678
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:08,667
Hello? I'm talking to

679
00:21:02,709 --> 00:21:08,667
you! You and you, you!

680
00:21:08,709 --> 00:21:11,375
Well, what's funny about spells?

681
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:16,667
I don't get it; I feel left out

682
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:16,667
and I feel really bad about it.

683
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,500
Sorry, buddy. Guess

684
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,500
you had to be there.

685
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,041
[POOF]

686
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:28,166
[laughter]
