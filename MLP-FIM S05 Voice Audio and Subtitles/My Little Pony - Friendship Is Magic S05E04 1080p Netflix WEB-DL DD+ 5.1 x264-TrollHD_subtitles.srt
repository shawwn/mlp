It's been a busy

580
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,542
night for us all,

581
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,166
but I think it's time

582
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:24,166
to bring it to a close.

583
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,166
Princess Luna!

584
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,834
I know you've all had a

585
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,834
lot on your minds tonight,

586
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,667
but I think Apple Bloom has

587
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,667
something she'd like to share

588
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,500
before you wake.

589
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:41,583
We're still asleep?

590
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:42,625
Cool!

591
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,083
Well, I guess I should

592
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,083
call this dream meeting

593
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,542
of the Cutie Mark

594
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:51,542
Crusaders to order.

595
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,166
I know we all got pretty

596
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,166
anxious when we found out

597
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,959
Babs got her cutie mark.

598
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,667
But I, for one, don't wanna

599
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,667
have nightmares every night

600
00:19:59,709 --> 00:20:01,583
from now until we get ours.

601
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:02,834
Me neither.

602
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,792
And even though we're

603
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,792
all a little scared,

604
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,667
a cutie mark won't

605
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:06,667
change who we are

606
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,834
or how everypony

607
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:08,834
feels about us.

608
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,291
It's lucky we're all

609
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:11,291
scared of the same things.

610
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,208
That way we can help

611
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:13,208
and remind each other

612
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,041
to just be who we are.

613
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,834
And when the day comes

614
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,625
that you all finally

615
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,625
get your cutie marks,

616
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,083
you can be sure they'll

617
00:20:18,667 --> 00:20:21,083
fit you to a tee.

618
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:22,750
Exactly.

619
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,917
Do you fillies think that

620
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:24,917
Babs is worried or scared

621
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,917
about some of this stuff?

622
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:28,125
I know!

623
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,625
Let's put together a

624
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:30,625
care package for her!

625
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,875
That way she'll know

626
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:32,875
she isn't alone!

627
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:34,125
We wouldn't want

628
00:20:32,917 --> 00:20:34,125
her to think

629
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,959
that just because she

630
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:35,959
isn't a Crusader,

631
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,709
we can't still be friends.

632
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,291
But...

633
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,709
maybe we should wait

634
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,709
until we wake up.

635
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,959
