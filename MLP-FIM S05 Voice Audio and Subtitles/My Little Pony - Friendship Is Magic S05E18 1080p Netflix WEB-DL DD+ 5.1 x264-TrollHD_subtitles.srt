going anywhere.

574
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,709
And I know that you're always

575
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:24,709
gonna be here when I need you.

576
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,333
Heck, you'll do a whole

577
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,333
obstacle course in high heels

578
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,583
if you think it'll help

579
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,583
me get somethin' I want.

580
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,500
You're my big brother.

581
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:38,250
You've always been a hero to me,

582
00:20:33,542 --> 00:20:38,250
Big Mac, and you always will be.

583
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,208
I'm real sorry I haven't

584
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:40,208
been lettin' you know

585
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:41,792
that's how I feel.

586
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,834
Guess both of us have

587
00:20:41,834 --> 00:20:43,834
been holdin' back

588
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,917
when it comes to

589
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,917
expressin' ourselves, huh?

590
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:49,041
Eyup.

591
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:51,625
Granny: Big Mac! Apple Bloom!

592
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,625
Your sister's home! She says

593
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,625
she's got quite a story to tell

594
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,458
about her trip to Manehattan.

595
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:01,125
Be there in a bit.

596
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,208
I'm spending some quality

597
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:04,208
time with my big brother!

598
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,709
Hey, Big Mac.

599
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,083
Eyup.

600
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,667
How do you think

601
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,667
Cousin Orchard Blossom

602
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:13,834
would describe this sunset?

603
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:18,000
Why, dear, I do declare this

604
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:18,000
is the most beautiful sunset

605
00:21:18,041 --> 00:21:20,458
my eyes have ever looked upon.

606
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,166
Though sittin' here

607
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,166
on these tree roots

608
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,291
is a trifle uncomfortable

609
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,291
for my hindquarters.

610
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:29,333
[giggling]
