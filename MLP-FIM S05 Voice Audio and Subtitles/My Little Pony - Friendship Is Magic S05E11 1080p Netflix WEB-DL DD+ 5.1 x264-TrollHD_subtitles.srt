00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:38,625
You know? It's going OK.

195
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,875
Satisfactory, I'd say.

196
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:43,000
It could be better.

197
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,333
It's not very good.

198
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,208
It's a disaster!

199
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,959
Pinkie Pie. Tonight's

200
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,959
Yakyakistan-theme party

201
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,625
is more important than ever.

202
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,667
You'll make them forget all

203
00:06:51,667 --> 00:06:54,667
about this afternoon, right?

204
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:57,709
Because if it's not perfect,

205
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,667
they're going to

206
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,667
smash everything,

207
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:03,208
and I'm not sure how much more

208
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:03,208
smashing this visit can take!

209
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,375
I definitely will,

210
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,375
I think... maybe?

211
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:10,333
You're the best gosh-darn

212
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:10,333
party planner in Equestria.

213
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:12,125
You'll show 'em a good time.

214
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,834
You can do it.

215
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,667
We have absolute confidence in

216
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,667
your abilities, Pinkie Pie.

217
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,750
It's going to be my most

218
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:20,750
happy-tacular party ever...

219
00:07:20,792 --> 00:07:21,834
I hope!

220
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,750
Why are your eyes

221
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:26,750
darting around like that?

222
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:30,125
It's what I do when I'm not

223
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:30,125
nervous! Hahahahahahaha!

224
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,375
Pinkie Pie, I don't know

225
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,375
what we'd do without you.

226
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,625
Me either! GOTTA GO!

227
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:44,458
[gasping breaths]

228
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,333
Gummy! What am I gonna do?

229
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,542
I have all this amazing

230
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:48,542
stuff planned for the party

231
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,041
but they're going to hate it!

232
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,917
There's no way to make Equestria

233
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,917
feel like Yakyakistan.

234
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,125
They're just too sensitive.

235
00:07:56,166 --> 00:08:02,041
Even Fluttershy made

236
00:07:56,166 --> 00:08:02,041
them mad. FLUTTERSHY!

237
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,250
Oh, I need a new idea,

238
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,250
and I need it now.

239
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,208
How am I supposed to make this

240
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:08,208
party feel like Yakyakistan

241
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,792
without actually going there

242
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,792
and bringing something back?

243
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,041
[gasp]

244
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:17,041
Gummy, you're a genius!

245
00:08:17,083 --> 00:08:17,959
[kiss]

246
00:08:19,417 --> 00:08:21,834
And this is Sugarcube Corner.

247
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,125
They're working hard to make you

248
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:25,125
a traditional Yakyakistan cake.

249
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,000
VANILLA EXTRACT

250
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:28,000
BALANCE VERY TRICKY!

251
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,709
Do you mind, um, waiting

252
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:32,709
here for one moment?

253
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,709
How's tonight's party coming?

254
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,583
I'm doing what I can, but it's

255
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,583
really up to you at this point.

256
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:43,333
Pinkie? Where are you?

257
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:52,959
Did you find her?

258
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,083
Angel and I searched

259
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,083
the forest, but...

260
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,917
Aerial recon turned

261
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:58,917
up nothing, either.

262
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,333
I searched the farm inside

263
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,333
and out. No Pinkie Pie.

264
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,583
But I did find a set of

265
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,583
Granny Smith's dentures

266
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,375
under the house. So...not

267
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:08,375
a complete loss.

268
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:10,166
She's simply vanished!

269
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,792
But the party, it's all we have

270
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:13,792
left. What are we going to do?

271
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,834
"Don't worry. I'll be back

272
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,834
in time for the party.

273
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,291
Love, Pinkie Pie."

274
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,291
If Pinkie Pie says she'll be

275
00:09:24,709 --> 00:09:27,291
back in time for the party,

276
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,667
she'll be back.

277
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,375
We have to trust her. Right?

278
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:32,375
No reason to FREAK OUT.

279
00:09:32,417 --> 00:09:34,125
Don't worry, Twilight.

280
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:35,375
When it comes to parties,

281
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,625
I think she knows

282
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:37,625
what she's doing.

283
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:39,125
[sigh]

284
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,959
You're right, let's just focus

285
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,959
on keeping the yaks happy

286
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,458
till she's back.

287
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,333
Piece of cake.

288
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,083
The cake!

289
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,959
One bite and you'll

290
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:48,959
be transported

291
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,250
right back to

292
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,250
Yakyakistan. Ha ha!

293
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,709
I hope.

294
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:58,834
[munching]

295
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:03,000
PONIES TOO HEAVY ON

296
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:03,000
VANILLA EXTRACT! BWAR!

297
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,208
We've never needed

298
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:06,208
a party so badly.

299
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,125
Next stop, Crystal Empire!

300
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,125
And so my quest begins.

301
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:21,709
I know what you're thinking:

302
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,834
"Why go to Yakyakistan

303
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,834
alone, Pinkie Pie?"

304
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,291
Because I'm the party planner.

305
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:32,000
This burden falls on my

306
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:32,000
rump, and my rump alone.

307
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,542
If I want a great party,

308
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,458
I gotta climb the mountains

309
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:36,458
North of the Crystal Empire,

310
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,041
find Yakyakistan, and come

311
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:41,041
back with something authentic.

312
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,125
Know what I mean?

313
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,792
[crash and screaming brakes]

314
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,375
Did we go the wrong way?

315
00:10:50,417 --> 00:10:51,792
Where's all the snow?

316
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,625
Please tell me this is

317
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:54,625
magical sand-colored snow!

318
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,917
Pthew! Nope! Sand.

319
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:59,917
Definitely sand.

320
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,625
Dodge City. End of

321
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,625
the line, I'm afraid.

322
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:06,375
All trains had to stop. Sheep

323
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:06,375
decided to sit on the tracks.

324
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:07,875
[bleating]

325
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,750
CURSE YOU, SHEEP!

326
00:11:09,792 --> 00:11:11,125
Thanks for your help, Conductor.

327
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,333
Cherry Jubilee!

328
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,083
Pinkie Pie? I reckoned

329
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:20,083
I eyeballed you

330
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,792
crossin' my way right now.

331
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:25,208
How ARE you? You look

332
00:11:21,834 --> 00:11:25,208
amazing! I need help!

333
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,375
I'm dandy as a daffodil

334
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,375
and fit as a floribunda.

335
00:11:28,417 --> 00:11:30,041
What can I do ya for?

336
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,667
Have you heard of Yakyakistan?

337
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:33,875
Do you have ANY idea

338
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:33,875
how I could get there?

339
00:11:33,917 --> 00:11:35,125
Mark your calender, missy,

340
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,375
cause this right

341
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,375
here's your lucky day.

342
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:41,208
I'm headin' north to the Crystal

343
00:11:37,417 --> 00:11:41,208
Empire myself for a delivery.

344
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,458
I oughta warn you, though. Me

345
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,458
and the boys are powerful tired

346
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,083
cause we was up all

347
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,083
night countin' cherries.

348
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:50,125
Hey there! Wake up!

349
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,458
Counting cherries? How many?

350
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,125
Four hundred and

351
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,125
seventeen thousand,

352
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,250
two hundred and

353
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:57,250
thirty-four. YEE-HAW!

354
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,291
Whoa!

355
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,792
And so my quest resumes.

356
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:06,583
As I stare across

357
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:06,583
the endless desert,

358
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,792
I tell myself I will soon

359
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,792
triumphantly enter the homeland

360
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,583
of our noble guests

361
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,583
and return with a prize

362
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,291
to make the best party

363
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:15,291
they've ever seen.

364
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,542
You know what I mean?

365
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,083
Cherry?

366
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,375
RAVINE! RAVINE!

00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:33,792
WAKE UP!

371
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,792
STOP!

372
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,834
[crash]

373
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,291
Whoa! I was dreamin'

374
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,291
about a ravine.

375
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,583
RAVINE!

376
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,709
That's what I said!

00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,667

00:20:13,417 --> 00:20:15,458
every time we tried

575
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,375
to make something in Equestria

576
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,375
feel like Yakyakistan,.

577
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,792
we couldn't get it right.

578
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:22,959
When I got back from my

579
00:20:19,834 --> 00:20:22,959
adventure, I realized something.

580
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,834
We shouldn't try to make

581
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,834
Equestria feel like your home.

582
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,458
We should try to make you

583
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:29,458
feel at home in Equestria.

584
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,667
And that means showing

585
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:32,667
you why we love it here,

586
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:34,500
so you'll love it too.

587
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:44,834
Pink pony work hard to make yaks

588
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:44,834
feel at home. Now yaks happy.

589
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:47,000
No declare war.

590
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,125
[relieved sigh]

591
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,291
Ponies and yaks. Friends?

592
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,083
For a thousand moons?

593
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:58,208
For a thousand MOONS!

594
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:02,250
[cheers]

595
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,667
I am very impressed, Princess.

596
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:08,417
Ha hah. Just doing my

597
00:21:04,709 --> 00:21:08,417
best to spread friendship.

598
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:14,458
And you did a wonderful job

599
00:21:08,458 --> 00:21:14,458
of it. You and your friends.

600
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,959
Pink Pony? You

601
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,959

602
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,250
