00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,542
ceremony this afternoon

196
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,417
and I still haven't

197
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:16,417
sorted out what to play.

198
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,875
How am I meant to practice with

199
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:19,875
a monster invading Ponyville?

200
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,458
Maybe it's just a

201
00:06:19,917 --> 00:06:21,458
friendship problem

202
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,625
and it'll all be cleared up

203
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,625
in a half an hour or so.

204
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,417
Ugh. I hope so.

205
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,125
Where's Pinkie Pie? I need

206
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,125
my wedding planner!

207
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,375
[growl]

208
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,792
[loud growl]

209
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,291
[scream]

210
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:45,000
[growls]

211
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,125
Oh no! On my wedding day?

212
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:51,166
SOMEPONY'S GOT TO HELP ME!

213
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,125
You!

214
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,542
Me?

215
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,458
I need to move an entire

216
00:06:58,583 --> 00:07:01,458
wedding from tomorrow to today!

217
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,333
But nopony's asked me

218
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,333
to organize anything

219
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,083
since Twilight came to town!

220
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,583
So you'll do it?

221
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,333
I used to be the best

222
00:07:06,625 --> 00:07:10,333
organizer in all of Ponyville.

223
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,375
You bet I'll--

224
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,750
[growl]

225
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:14,625
[yell]

226
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,667
[crash]

227
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,583
Come on, we'd better

228
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:19,583
get to the salon

229
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,000
before that monster

230
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,000
flattens it!

231
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,583
[roar]

232
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,917
[roar]

233
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:30,542
What am I gonna do?

234
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,542
[gasp]

235
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:33,583
Matilda!

236
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,125
I feel so bad about

237
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:36,125
the invitations!

238
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:37,875
Is there anything I can do?

239
00:07:37,917 --> 00:07:39,375
FLOWERS!

240
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,959
You want Matilda's

241
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,959
arrangements today?

242
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:48,083
This is awful!

243
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:50,542
The horror! The horror!

244
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,125
So there's no way you can do it?

245
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,166
We don't even have

246
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:55,166
Matilda's flowers in yet,

247
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,667
much less arranged.

248
00:07:56,709 --> 00:07:58,959
Oh. This is a disaster!

249
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,208
OK, thanks anyway.

250
00:08:03,834 --> 00:08:05,750
Look, girls!

251
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,458
A broken stem on

252
00:08:05,792 --> 00:08:08,458
one of the zinnias!

253
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,875
WHAT?

254
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,959
Oh the horror!

255
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,500
The horror!

256
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,917
I have to admit, when Matilda

257
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,917
said we needed this place

258
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,208
ready by today, I was

259
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:21,208
a little nervous.

260
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,875
With you by my side, I knew

261
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,875
we'd get it done in time.

262
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:28,291
There is nothing like a

263
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:28,291
best friend, is there?

264
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,458
Anything's possible

265
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:30,458
when you know somepony

266
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,625
as well as we know each other.

267
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:34,667
[distant growl]

268
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:36,083
What was that?

269
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,750
There's some monster attacking

270
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,750
Ponyville or something.

271
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:42,083
What is it this time, a creature

272
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:42,083
from the Ever-Free Forest?

273
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,834
Uh, I think it's

274
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,834
some sort of Bugbear.

275
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:46,041
[giggle]

276
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,834
Did you say Bugbear?

277
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:49,542
He found me.

278
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,250
What are you talking

279
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,250
about, Bon Bon?

280
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:56,250
My name isn't Bon Bon; it's

281
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:56,250
Special Agent Sweetie Drops.

282
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,792
I work for a super-secret

283
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:58,792
anti-monster agency

284
00:08:58,834 --> 00:09:00,125
in Canterlot.

285
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,208
Or at least I did until the

286
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,208
Bugbear went missing

287
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,000
from Tartarus a few years back.

288
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:06,500
What are you talking about?

289
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:09,125
When it escaped, we had to

290
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:09,125
shutter the whole agency.

291
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,500
Every last shred of evidence

292
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:13,208
of the organization's

293
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:13,208
existence was destroyed.

294
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,542
Celestia demanded

295
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,542
complete deniability.

296
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:18,208
What?

297
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,875
It was me who

298
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:19,875
captured the Bugbear.

299
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,041
I had to go deep cover

300
00:09:19,917 --> 00:09:22,041
here in Ponyville

301
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,500
and assume the name Bon Bon.

302
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,917
I never thought it'd

303
00:09:23,542 --> 00:09:25,917
be able to track me.

304
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:27,667
But now it has.

305
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,959
Are you saying our whole

306
00:09:27,709 --> 00:09:31,959
friendship was based on a lie?

307
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,792
I'm sorry, Lyra, I couldn't tell

308
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,792
you for your own protection.

309
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:39,000
But, but the lunches,

310
00:09:35,834 --> 00:09:39,000
the, the long talks,

311
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,291
the benches we've sat on!

312
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,792
None of that was real?

313
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:44,250
It was all real.

314
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,500
You're my very best friend.

315
00:09:46,542 --> 00:09:47,875
[distant growl]

316
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,834
I've got to go find a

317
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,834
crowd to blend into

318
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,333
before I put you in danger.

319
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,834
I'll see you at the wedding.

320
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,917
Fine. But we're going to

321
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,917
talk about this later!

322
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,792
I need my ring today,

323
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:03,792
no matter the cost!

324
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:06,000
As long as it doesn't

325
00:10:03,834 --> 00:10:06,000
cost any extra.

326
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,542
7-10 split, man.

327
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:11,542
Harshest of the harsh.

328
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,959
But if you pick this up,

329
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,959
we win the whole shebang.

330
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:22,291
Doc! I finally figured

331
00:10:18,709 --> 00:10:22,291
out how I can help!

332
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,458
Your flameless fireworks

333
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,458
look just like flowers!

334
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,083
I'll use them for the wedding!

335
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,709
Great whickering

336
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:30,709
stallions. Wait!

337
00:10:39,667 --> 00:10:40,875
Wait!

338
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,792
The flameless fireworks

339
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:42,792
are extremely volatile!

340
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,250
Without knowing

341
00:10:42,834 --> 00:10:44,250
what the trigger is,

342
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:45,875
they could go off at any moment!

343
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:48,917
My word, is that a Bugbear?

344
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,792
Matilda: There are so many

345
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,792
things I'm forgetting!

346
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,625
I hope Cranky remembers

347
00:10:56,834 --> 00:10:59,625
to tell the musicians.

348
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:03,959
Oh, oh! I'll never get

349
00:10:59,667 --> 00:11:03,959
my mane done in time!

350
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,542
You must relax, my dear!

351
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,542
We can handle anything.

352
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,667
We once did a pony's

353
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:12,667
hair during the ceremony.

354
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,709
Oh, it's true!

355
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,709
It's true!

356
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,667
They really are the best!

357
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,458
Matilda, I've just got to say I

358
00:11:16,709 --> 00:11:21,458
already feel like we're family.

359
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,625
You do?

360
00:11:22,667 --> 00:11:23,875
Of course!

361
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:27,375
I'm Stephen Magnet,

362
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:27,375
Cranky's best beast!

363
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:29,208
You're Stephen Magnet?

364
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, what'd you

365
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,000
expect, a Bugbear?

366
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:33,834
I've known Cranky forever!

367
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,041
Surely he must have told

368
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,041
you about the time

369
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,208
he saved me from

370
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,208
Flashfreeze Lake.

371
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,834
You're Stephen Magnet?

372
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,834
Oh, I know, I KNOW!

373
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,792
Typical Cranky to leave

374
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,792
out minor details,

375
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:49,417
like the fact that I'm, you

376
00:11:45,834 --> 00:11:49,417
know, a sea monster, right?

377
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,041
[laugh]

378
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,166
Oh, I just love that old burro.

379
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,250
I'm sorry, Stephen, I guess

380
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:57,250
I assumed you were a pony.

381
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,709
And I had no idea you had

382
00:11:57,291 --> 00:12:00,709
such adventures together.

383
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,583
Oh, honey! You don't

384
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,583
know the half of it.

385
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,208
But let me tell you something:

389

The only thing that matters

You bet I do.
