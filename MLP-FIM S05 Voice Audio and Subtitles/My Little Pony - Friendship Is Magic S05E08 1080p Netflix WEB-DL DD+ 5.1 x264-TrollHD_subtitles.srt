And according to this book, it

92
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,583
has a rich, fascinating history.

93
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,709
In ancient times, griffons

94
00:02:47,166 --> 00:02:49,709
were known to be as greedy

95
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,458
as dragons, always hoarding

96
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,458
their bits and other treasures.

97
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,375
But all that changed

98
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,375
when King Grover

99
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:58,667
found the mysterious

100
00:02:55,417 --> 00:02:58,667
golden idol of Boreas!

101
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,875
Legend says the idol

102
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:00,875
of Boreas was made

103
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:02,875
from the dust of

104
00:03:00,917 --> 00:03:02,875
golden sunsets,

105
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,583
blown across the mountains

106
00:03:02,917 --> 00:03:05,583
by the north winds.

107
00:03:05,625 --> 00:03:07,208
Possessing the idol of Boreas

108
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,417
filled the griffons'

109
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,417
hearts with pride.

110
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,208
It's said that that one great

111
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,208
treasure is responsible

112
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,959
for turning Griffonstone into

113
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,959
the most majestic kingdom

114

115
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:20,125
And why do you care so much

116
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:20,125
about griffons, anyway?

117
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,667
It was actually Gilda's

118
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:22,667
visit that made me curious.

119
00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:25,458
So I picked up "Bygone

121
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,125

194
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,417
<i>and you're there to help</i>

195
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,417

196
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,792
<i>If for some reason</i>

197
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,792
<i>the King can't help,</i>

198
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,208
<i>I'd try the Griffonstone</i>

199
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:30,208

200
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,417
<i>It's a little known secret that</i>

201
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,417
<i>if you befriend a librarian,</i>

202
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,709
<i>you can usually</i>

203
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,709
<i>find out anything.</i>

204
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,125
<i>Plus, as a bonus, there's a</i>

205
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,125
<i>statue of King Grover outside!</i>

206
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,667
<i>Photo op!</i>

207
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:43,291
<i>And don't forget to sample</i>

208
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:43,291
<i>some famous Griffon Scones!</i>

209
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,542
<i>They're supposed to be the best!</i>

210
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,333
Aw, Twilight should

211
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,333
have come along.

212
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,417
Then she could have seen first

213
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:50,417
hoof that Griffonstone is...

214
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,750
...a total dump!

215
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:07,917
Ugh, maybe the map should have

216
00:06:02,834 --> 00:06:07,917
called Rarity instead of us.

217
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:10,917
Excuse me, sir?

218
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,125
This is Griffonstone, right?

219
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, that wasn't

220
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:18,000
very nice.

221
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,542
See? These griffons are exactly

222
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,542
what I thought they'd be.

223
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,709
Maybe we should just

224
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,709
find the palace

225
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,458
so we can ask the

226
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,458
king what's going on.

227
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,125
We don't have a

228
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,125
king, losers.

229
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,667
Hello, Gilda.

230
00:06:30,542 --> 00:06:31,709
Dash.

231
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,125
Pinkie!

232
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,625
What're you

233
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,625
doing here?

234
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:36,500
Uh, I'm a griffon?

235
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:38,625
What's your excuse, dweebs?

236
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,542
Hey! These dweebs are here

237
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:41,542
to help Griffonstone!

238
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,000
Help it what?

239
00:06:43,041 --> 00:06:45,250
Well, we're not really sure.

240
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,709
But it involves a map and Cutie

241
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:47,709
Marks and a problem and...

242
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,709
Bored now.

243
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,083
Well, if you don't have a king,

244
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,375
can you at least tell us

245
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,375
where the idol of Boreas is?

246
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:56,750
Ha-ha! Don't tell me you really

247
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:56,750
believe in that thing.

248
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,000
Old man voice: You'd

249
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,000
better believe in it!

250
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:02,834
<i>[cough]</i>

251
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,750
[crash]

252
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:09,083
The idol was the best thing

253
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:09,083
to ever happen to us griffons!

254
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,500
Oh, great!

255
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:13,625
Now you got Grampa

256
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:13,625
Gruff started.

257
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll tell you the whole

258
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:19,000
tragic tale...heh heh heh.

259
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,875
For a couple of bits.

260
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,291
[sigh]

261
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:25,458
[clinking coins]

262
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,792
The first griffon

263
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,792
king, King Grover,

264
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:38,917
united our kind like we've never

265
00:07:32,834 --> 00:07:38,917
been united before or since.

266
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,667
And he did it all with that

267
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,667
incredible idol of Boreas.

268
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,250
That idol brought

269
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,250
pride to the heart

270
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,417
of every griffon that saw it.

271
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:57,083
From one king to the next,

272
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:57,083
Griffonstone and our golden idol

273
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,792
were the envy of

274
00:07:57,125 --> 00:08:00,792
all other species.

275
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:05,417
It held us together,

276
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:05,417
gave us an identity.

277
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:09,583
Right up until the

278
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:09,583
reign of King Guto.

279
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,125
[thunderclap]

280
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,792
That's when Arimaspi came.

281
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,667
To steal our griffon treasure.

282
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,667
King Guto tried

283
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:19,667
to fight him off,

284
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,625
but Arimaspi managed to

285
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:23,625
get away with the idol.

286
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,250
[thunder]

287
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,500
They say when our treasure

288
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:35,500
fell into the Abysmal Abyss,

289
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,625
our pride went with it.

290
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:42,250
King Guto was the last

291
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:42,250
king of Griffonstone

292
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,625
and we all lived

293
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,625
miserably ever after.

294
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:45,750
The end.

295
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,875
That was the saddest story ever.

296
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh, well ... tough

297
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:53,000
tailfeathers! No refunds!

298
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:54,250
No wonder Twilight's book ended

299
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,959
with the coronation

300
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:55,959
of King Guto.

301
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,291
Who would want to record

302
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,291
a history that sad?

303
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,667
It's not sad.

304
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,458
Do we look sad to you?

305
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,500
Pinkie, I think I know

306
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,500
why the map sent us here!

307
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,291
We need to find

308
00:09:10,542 --> 00:09:12,291
the idol of Boreas

309
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,041
and bring glory and pride

310
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:15,041
back to Griffonstone!

311
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,166
Ha ha.

312
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,667
Here we go, typical

313
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,667
pony hero complex.

314
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,625
None of us care about

315
00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:21,625
that dumb old idol.

316
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,166
Don't you get it?

317
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:27,166
We don't care about anything

318
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:27,166
and that's the way we like it.

319
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,875
I think Rainbow Dash is right.

320
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,125
The map sent us here to

321
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,125
fix some sort of problem.

322
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,875
The only problem

323
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,875
Griffonstone has is you!

324
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,959
Well, I don't care

325
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,959
what she says.

326
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,375
We're going to

327
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,375
find that treasure,

328
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,083
make Griffonstone cool again,

329
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,083
and get back to Ponyville.

330
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,625
C'mon!

331
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,166
Wait, Rainbow Dash, what

332
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,166
about Twilight's advice?

333
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,333
What, taking a

334
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,333
bunch of pictures?

335
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,709
She mentioned finding

336
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,709
answers at the library.

337
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,458
Knock yourself out.

338
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,583
But when you get bored

339
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,583
with Twilight's tour book,

340
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,917
I'll be at the Abysmal Abyss

341
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:01,917
finding the idol of Boreas.

342
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,333
I'm here to find your missing

343
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,333
idol and save Griffonstone!

344
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,792
Uh, I'll need some

345
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,792
rope, a grappling hook,

346
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,333
and a guide to take me

347
00:10:17,834 --> 00:10:20,333
down to the Abysmal Abyss.

348
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,709
And I'll need some bits.

349
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,083
Hey, Gilda!

350
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,875
Word on the street is that

351
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:31,875
Griffonstone has an amazing

352
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:33,917
library chock-full of answers!

353
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:36,000
Word on what street?

354
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:37,709
OK, maybe not this street.

355
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,125
But on other streets, your

356
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,125
library is the talk of the town.

357
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,417
The library's right there

358
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:43,583
so why don't you go inside

359
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:44,709
AND LEAVE ME ALONE!

360
00:10:52,709 --> 00:10:53,875
[gasp]

361
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,458
Maybe it's good that

362
00:10:53,917 --> 00:10:56,458
Twilight didn't come.

363
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,166
It's sad what happened

364
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:04,166
to your town, King.

365
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:05,959
But Rainbow Dash can't be right.

366
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,166
This can't all be because

367
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,166
of a missing hunk of gold.

368
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,041
"You're right, Pinkie.

369
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,333
And you've got amazing hair."

370
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,417
Aw, King Grover,

371
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:16,417
you old charmer.

372
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,625
I know what Griffonstone needs!

373
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,625
Fewer ponies?

374
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,083
A song!

375
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,000
I've got a super

376
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,000
song about smiling

377
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,333
that's sure to make even the

378
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,333
most grumpy griffon grin!

379
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,583
[big inhale]

380
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:38,583
You can't sing here.

381
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,792
But how do you break into

382
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,792
uplifting musical numbers

383
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:44,166
with no singing?

384
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,625
Yeah, that's Griffonstone's

385
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,625
biggest problem.

386
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,792
Lack of uplifting

387
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,792
musical numbers.

388
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,542
Well, if I can't sing,

389
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,542
how 'bout a party?

390
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,041
If there's one thing

391
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:53,041
these griffons need,

392
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,625
it's some good cheer.

393
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,208
Where's your party store?

394
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,917
No party store?

395
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:00,417
Aw. How about cake?

396
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,917
Nothing cheers

397
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:01,917
folks up like cake!

398
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,333
Where's your bakery?

399
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,875
[groan]

400
00:12:04,917 --> 00:12:05,834
NO SINGING?

401
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,333
NO PARTY STORE?

402
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,917
NO BAKERY?

403
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,208
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

404
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,208
You're welcome to

405
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,208
leave at any time.

406
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,125
[crash]

407
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,166
Well, that just takes the cake.

408
00:12:18,208 --> 00:12:19,417
Wait, no.

409
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,417
It can't take the cake

410
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,417
cause there is no cake!

411
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:22,583
Or muffins!

412
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,417
Or Griffon Scones!

413
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,041
Oh, we got Griffon Scones.

414
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:27,375
That's my specialty.

415
00:12:27,417 --> 00:12:28,458
I'll buy one!

416
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,417
[chomp]

417
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,458
Bits first.

418
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:40,583
[crackling]

419
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,625
Well?

420
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:43,417
[crackling]

421
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,291
What, you like it?

422
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,000
That's my Grampa

423
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,000
Gruff's secret recipe.

424
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,458
[snap]

425
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,875
Ow! I think I broke a tooth.

426
00:12:51,917 --> 00:12:54,625
Well, whatever, no refunds.

427
00:12:54,667 --> 00:12:56,375
I don't even care anyway.

428
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,875
I just want to sell

429
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,875
enough of these

430
00:12:57,917 --> 00:12:59,917
so I can leave this lousy town.

431
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,458
I can help you with that!

432
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,875
[whistling wind]

433
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,959
Uh, you think you could

434
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,959
tighten the strap on my helmet?

435
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,542
Can you give me more bits?

436
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:13,959
Never mind.

437
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,500
I got it.

438
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,041
So how deep is this abyss?

439
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:19,709
How deep are your pockets?

440
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,208
Don't you griffons ever talk

441
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,208
about anything but bits?

442
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,375
Give me some bits

443
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:25,375
and I'll answer.

444
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,709
No wonder Gilda's

445
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,709
such a delight.

446
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:31,709
Grampa Gruff's recipe is good,

447
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,041
but it's missing one

448
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,041
important ingredient.

449
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:36,500
Don't tell me...friendship?

450
00:13:36,542 --> 00:13:37,583
Uh, no.

451
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:39,625
Baking powder.

452
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,667
Lucky for you I never

453
00:13:39,667 --> 00:13:41,667
leave home without it!

454
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,000
Now just pop those in the oven

455
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,000
and you'll have Griffon Scones

456
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:46,625
worth their weight in gold!

457
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,291
[sniff sniff]

458
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,542
[crash]

459
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,500
Oof!

460
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,542
Greta!

461
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,291
Pinkie: AH-HA!

462
00:13:57,333 --> 00:13:58,583
I saw that, Gilda!

463
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,458
You may act like a

464
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,458
gruff, grumbling griffon,

465
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,583
but inside you're

466
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,583
gracious and great!

467
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,041
What are you talking about?

468
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,583
You just helped your friend

469
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,583
up when she got knocked down.

470
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,166
What, her?

471
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,208
Greta's just some

472
00:14:08,208 --> 00:14:10,208
griffon I know.

473
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,625
We don't have friends here.

474
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,166
[sigh]

475
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,458
I did have a friend once, but

476
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:17,458
you saw how that turned out.

477
00:14:20,917 --> 00:14:21,792
Oh my gosh!

478
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,917
I gotta go find Rainbow Dash!

479
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,000
See ya.

480
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:29,000
[whistling wind]

481
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:33,000
You sure we can't just fly down?

482
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:34,834
Whoa!

483
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:35,792
Never mind.

484
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,583
Totally got my answer there.

485
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,625
We just gotta find that Golden

486
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:45,625
Idol and get out of this place!

487
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:49,291
[snap]

488
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,333
Aaaaah!

489
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,291
Oof!

490
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,417
Oh! Owww!

491
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:54,417
Ooh!

492
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:55,417
My hoof!

493
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:56,417
Help!

494
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:57,458
Throw me another rope!

495
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,750
You got bits?

496
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,000
Wait!

497
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,375
HELP!

498
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:20,500
[whistling wind]

499
00:15:24,917 --> 00:15:26,583
AHHHHH!

500
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,333
Pinkie: There you are!

501
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,041
Forget about finding the idol.

502
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,083
I figured out how to solve

503
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:33,083
Griffonstone's real problem!

504
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:34,750
SCONES!

505
00:15:34,792 --> 00:15:37,500
PINKIE PIE, YOU GET BACK HERE!

506
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:38,959
Yeah?

507
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,333
Can you throw down

508
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,333
a rope or something?

509
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,291
Lemme look.

510
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:45,750
One rope, comin' up!

511
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,333
We need help!

512
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,917
Don't go anywhere!

513
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,166
Where does she

514
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:58,166
think I'm gonna go?

515
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,333
[crack]

516
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:00,291
Unh!

517
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,792
I hope I don't go anywhere!

518
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,583
Rainbow Dash is stuck on a

519
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,583
ledge in the Abysmal Abyss

520
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,959
and I need your

521
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,959
help to save her!

522
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,208
Not my problem.

523
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,542
Of course it's your problem!

524
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,792
She's your friend!

525
00:16:16,834 --> 00:16:18,291
Used to be.

526
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,417
Can't you remember when she was?

527
00:16:20,458 --> 00:16:22,041
Yeah.

528
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,166
Of course.

529
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:38,083
Doesn't that griffon know that

530
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:38,083
she's supposed to fly

531
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,041
at the Junior

532
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:41,041
Speedsters Flight Camp?

533
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,000
Maybe she just doesn't

534
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,000
want to make you look bad.

535
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:46,959
Hey there!

536
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,125
I'm Rainbow Dash.

537
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:49,750
And you are...?

538
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:53,083
Uh, G-Gilda?

539
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,625
You sure about that?

540
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,792
Stick with me, Gilda,

541
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,375
and those guys won't

542
00:16:57,834 --> 00:17:00,375
give you any more guff!

543
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,583
Whoa! You're awesome!

544
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,792
[giggle]

545
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:09,667
You too, Rainbow Dash!

546
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:14,375
[whoosh]

547
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:17,667
Well, Gilda, let's show

548
00:17:14,417 --> 00:17:17,667
these guys how it's done.

549
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:22,875
Junior Speedsters are our lives!

550
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,333
Sky bound soars

551
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,333
and daring dives!

552
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,792
Junior Speedsters

553
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,792
it's our quest,

554
00:17:27,834 --> 00:17:30,375
to someday be the VERY BEST!

555
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:34,625
Fine.

556
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:35,709
I'll help her.

557
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,458
But that doesn't

558
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,458
make me her friend.

559
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,542
Duly noted.

560
00:17:39,917 --> 00:17:42,375
Except it does.

561
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:48,625
[whistling wind]

562
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,875
Hang on, loser!

563
00:17:50,917 --> 00:17:53,959
I'm coming!

564
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,959
What took you so long, doofus?

565
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:02,750
[scream]

566
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:03,834
RAINBOW DASH!

567
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,291
I'M COMIN' FOR YA!

568
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,500
AAAAAAHHHH!

569
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,041
Gotcha!

570
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,959
Hold on, you two!

571
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,583
[grunts]

572
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:19,625
Huh?

573
00:18:21,709 --> 00:18:22,834
[gasp]

574
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:28,667
The idol of Boreas!

[grunts]

576
00:18:33,583 --> 00:18:34,667
I'm slipping!

577
00:18:34,709 --> 00:18:37,583
[grunts]

578
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:39,000
AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

579
00:18:52,417 --> 00:18:53,333
[snap]

580
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,875
The idol!

581
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:58,417
You're more important to me

582
00:18:54,917 --> 00:18:58,417
than some dumb chunk of gold!

583
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,041
[crumbling]

584
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,125
Hugging later!

585
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,583
Climbing NOW!

586
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,458
I'm really sorry about

587
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:13,458
how I treated you two.

588
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,709
Thanks, Gilda.

589
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,625
Apology accepted.

590
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,125
And I'm just sorry we

591
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,125
didn't get your idol back.

592
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,625
Now we'll never be able to

593
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:22,625
solve Griffonstone's problem.

594
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,000
That's what I was

595
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,000
trying to tell you!

596
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,917
The map didn't send us here to

597
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,917
find the lost idol of Boreas.

598
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,709
It sent us here to replace

599
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:30,709
it with something better!

600
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,667
Nothing's better than

601
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,667
gold to a griffon.

602
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:36,166
That's because you

603
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:36,166
don't have friendship.

604
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,500
If you can learn to care

605
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:38,500
about each other again,

606
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:43,000
Griffonstone could be a mightier

607
00:19:38,542 --> 00:19:43,000
kingdom than it ever was before!

608
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,792
And you don't need some

609
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,792
golden idol to do that.

610
00:19:45,834 --> 00:19:48,125
You just need each other.

611
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,166
Whoa, Pinkie.

612
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:52,125
That was...really sappy.

613
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:53,667
What can I say?

614
00:19:53,709 --> 00:19:54,875
That's how I roll.

615
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:57,875
Go on, Gilda.

616
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,333
Go make a friend.

617
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,500
I don't know, Pinkie.

618
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,667
You really think these

619
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:08,667
griffons are up for this?

620
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,959
We aren't exactly in

621
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,959
Ponyville, you know.

622
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,333
Gilda: OK.

623
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,583
So she was really weirded out

624
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,583
until I gave her the scone.

625
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,041
Then she tried it and

626
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:25,041
said it tasted good!

627
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:29,166
That's the first nice thing

628
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:29,166
any griffon's ever said to me!

629
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:32,667
Whoa, Pinkie!

630
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:35,083
I guess that really was the

631
00:20:32,709 --> 00:20:35,083
problem we needed to solve.

632
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,667
Baking powder makes baked

633
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:37,667
goods and friendships

634
00:20:37,709 --> 00:20:39,125
fluffy and delicious!

635
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,250
Well, we better

636
00:20:41,709 --> 00:20:43,250
be headin' home.

637
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:47,125
What? You want me to spread

638
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:47,125
friendship here by myself?

639
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,542
How am I supposed to do that?

640
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,166
I haven't even made

641
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,166
one single friend yet!

642
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,000
No, you haven't.

643
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:54,792
You've made two.

644
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:55,625
Hugging!

645
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,166
Hugging now!

646
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,959
But you'll come back

647
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,959
and visit, right?

648
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,917
Just try and stop us!

649
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:17,542
See you later,

650
00:21:14,834 --> 00:21:17,542
you old charmer.

651
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,083
Uh, Pinkie?

652
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,500
Who are you

653
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:20,500
talking to?

654
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:23,625
Nopony. Come on, let's go

655
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:23,625
home and see how Gummy did

656
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,500
with Granny Pie's

00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,500
