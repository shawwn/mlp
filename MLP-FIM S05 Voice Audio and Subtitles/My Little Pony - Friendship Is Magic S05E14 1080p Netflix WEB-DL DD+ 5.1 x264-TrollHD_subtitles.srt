00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:11,750
me feel like a Princess.

576
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:15,041
And this dress makes me

577
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:15,041
feel like a Princess!

578
00:19:17,542 --> 00:19:19,500
This gown is quite beautiful,

579
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:22,583
but it totally clashes

580
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:22,583
with my complexion.

581
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:27,375
Hmm. Perhaps you'd be even

582
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:27,375
more taken with this one.

583
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,542
It was inspired by the fountain

584
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,542
in the Canterlot Castle Garden.

585
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,208
I call it, "The

586
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,208
Fountain of Truth."

587
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,625
It's exactly what

588
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,625
I've been dreaming of!

589
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:39,041
Ooh! Well, then, I'll finish it

590
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:39,041
and the gown shall be yours!

591
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,625
How could I have forgotten?

592
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,500
This is what I've

593
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:45,500
been dreaming about!

Attention everypony! Canterlot

Carousel WILL NOT be closing!

606
00:20:15,959 --> 00:20:18,250
[cheers]

607
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:22,083
But this stuff's

608
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:22,083
still on sale, right?

609
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,667
Yes, yes, of course.

610
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:27,458
Oh, Rarity,

611
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:27,458
I'm so sorry!

612
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,709
I focused on that

613
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,709
one dress

614
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,250
and the rest of Rarity's

615
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:33,250
Royal Regalia paid the price.

616
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,625
Well, so did the

617
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,625
Princess Dress.

618
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,875
The more I sewed, the

619
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,875
more each dress lost its

620
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:43,875
Time, Love, and Couture becoming

621
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:43,875
Terrible, Lackluster and Common.

622
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:47,500
I think I finally understand

623
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:47,500
the Rules of Rarity

624
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,625
and will apply them

625
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:50,625
at my next job.

626
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:51,917
I beg your pardon?

627
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,709
The Rules of Rarity

628
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,709
are only to be applied

629
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,417
at Canterlot Carousel.

630
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,417
Which is why you must continue

631
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:58,417
to manage the boutique

632
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,959
while I'm in Ponyville.

633
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,291
Ponyville?

634
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,583
Well, yes, I'll come to

635
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,583
Canterlot with new designs

636
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,291
and to see the

637
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,291
customers, of course,

638
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,458
but Ponyville was always

639
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:08,458
going to be my home base.

640
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,583
Bobbins and

641
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,583
bodkins, Rarity!

642
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,291
Oh, thank you,

643
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,291
thank you!

644
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:16,458
And I promise to run everything

645
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:16,458
following your rules!

646
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,417
I would expect

647
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,417
nothing less!

648
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:23,875
OH MY GOSH! A SALE?! DO YOU

649
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:23,875
HAVE THAT PRINCESS DRESS?

650
00:21:23,917 --> 00:21:24,792
NO!

651
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:28,667
[laughter]
