00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,875
Well, while you were meetin'

382
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:29,875
with the school ponies,

383
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,083
he was demandin' all sorts

384
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,083
of stuff from Pinkie Pie.

385
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,709
Svengallop works very

386
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,709
hard as my manager, AJ.

387
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:38,834
So if he needs some things

388
00:12:35,834 --> 00:12:38,834
when we're on the road,

389
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,709
I don't see anything

390
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,709
wrong with that.

391
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:43,166
Well, do you see something

392
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:43,166
wrong with him telling Pinkie

393
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,625
that if she doesn't get

394
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,625
those things by tomorrow,

395
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,875
he'd pull you from

396
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,875
our charity festival?

397
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,125
What? But...he knows how

398
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,125
important charity is to me

399
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,000
and leaving the festival would

400
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:54,000
completely ruin my image!

401
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,458
I'm afraid Svengallop doesn't

402
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:57,458
give a pickled Pippin

403
00:12:57,583 --> 00:12:59,041
about your charity work.

404
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,500
That's not true!

405
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,959
Svengallop has always supported

406
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,959
me in all my interests.

407
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,125
You're just saying those

408
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:05,125
things because you're jealous.

409
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,625
Jealous of what? A pony who

410
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:08,625
hides behind a veil so thick

411
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,917
she can't see when

412
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,917
somepony's using her?

413
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,667
No, I'm not jealous

414
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:13,667
of that, Rara.

415
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,375
I am not Rara! I am

416
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,375
Countess Coloratura!

417
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,959
And while we may have been

418
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,959
friends when we were young,

419
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,417
we have clearly gone in

420
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,417
different directions!

421
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,041
It just ain't right!

422
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,166
He's manipulatin' her and

423
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:37,166
she's just not seein' it.

424
00:13:37,291 --> 00:13:39,208
Enough stewing! More peeling!

425
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:42,917
Sorry, Pinkie, but

426
00:13:40,917 --> 00:13:42,917
there is no way

427
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,792
I'm lettin' that

428
00:13:43,041 --> 00:13:44,792
lousy Svengallop

429
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:47,000
use my friend like that!

430
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:48,291
Ohhhh.

431
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,458
Countess Coloratura!

432
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,458
Wow, AJ! You said my real name.

433
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,166
I said your new name, but I

434
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,166
saw the real you hangin' out

435
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,083
with those school

436
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,083
ponies yesterday.

437
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,792
And I know somepony

438
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,792
that'd prefer

439
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,250
if you stopped doin'

440
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,250
those little events.

441
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:07,375
Oh, not this again.

442
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,458
C'mon, now. You just

443
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,458
gotta give me a chance

444
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,375
to prove what I'm

445
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:11,375
sayin' is true!

446
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,667
And just how are you

447
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,667
going to do that?

448
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:17,750
Do exactly what I say; we'll

449
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:17,750
see if that Svengallop

450
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,625
truly has your best

451
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,625
interests at heart.

452
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,125
Svengallop? Svengallop?

453
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,542
Where are you, Svengallop?

454
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,542
Here I am. Did you

455
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,542
need something?

456
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:32,333
Yes, I was...considering...

457
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,208
maybe canceling the contest

458
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:36,208
with the school ponies?

459
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,709
Countess, this is

460
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,709
wonderful!

461
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,709
I've been waiting

462
00:14:38,834 --> 00:14:40,709
forever for you to cancel

463
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:43,041
that pointless

464
00:14:40,834 --> 00:14:43,041
school pony contest!

465
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,083
You...have?

466
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:49,417
You do it at every charity event

467
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:49,417
and it does absolutely nothing

468
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:53,667
to promote the Countess

469
00:14:49,542 --> 00:14:53,667
Coloratura image that I built!

470
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,375
Consider it CANCELED!

471
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,667
Pinkie Pie!

472
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:59,083
Yes, Svengallop, sir?

473
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:01,291
[coughing]

474
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:05,250
We're making some adjustments

475
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:05,250
to the show. Follow me!

476
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,875
Cancel the contest

477
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,875
for the fillies

478
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,208
and schedule

479
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,208
me a spa treatment.

480
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,500
Now that I don't have to oversee

481
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:22,500
a rehearsal with those brats,

482
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,500
I have time for the works.

483
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,834
You know the drill:

484
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,417
deliver, or the diva

485
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,417
ditches your dippy charity.

486
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:36,750
OK, Countess Coloratura!

487
00:15:31,709 --> 00:15:36,750
All taken care of!

488
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,709
<i>recording plays through PA:</i>

489
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,709
<i>You know the drill:</i>

490
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:42,250
<i>deliver, or the diva</i>

491
00:15:38,834 --> 00:15:42,250
<i>ditches your dippy charity.</i>

492
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,166
So that's how you've

493
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:45,166
been managing things?

494
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:47,667
Yeah, so? What's the problem?

495
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,875
The problem is that

496
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:49,875
you've been using my name

497
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,166
to intimidate ponies

498
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,166
to get what you want.

499
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:56,709
But I work incredibly hard for

500
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:56,709
you! I deserve everything I get!

501
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,625
But not because you scare ponies

502
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:59,625
into thinking I won't perform

503
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,333
for their charities otherwise!

504
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,709
I would never do

505
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:03,709
that to my fans.

506
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,250
Which is why you should have

507
00:16:03,834 --> 00:16:06,250
known that I would never

508
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,625
cancel the School

509
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,625
Ponies Contest!

510
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,458
Hmm. All this charity and

511
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:12,458
school pony contest nonsense

512
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,542
is just remnants of that

513
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:15,542
boring little Rara

514
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:17,583
I met back in Manehattan.

515
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,625
You clearly don't

516
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:20,625
understand the real me.

517
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,417
That's a joke! I

518
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:24,417
made you somepony.

519
00:16:24,542 --> 00:16:27,417
What can you even do without me?

520
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:32,250
Good luck, Countess

521
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:32,250
Coloratura! Good luck!

522
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,250
Oh, Rara! I'm so sorry.

523
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,834
Are you gonna be OK for

524
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,834
the concert tonight?

525
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,250
Of course. After all,

526
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,250
the show must go on!

527
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,125
Oh, my gosh, Rarity!

528
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:48,125
Svengallop's right!

529
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,458
This is going to be a disaster!

530
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,458
I'm gonna be terrible!

531
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,417
Can you give us

532
00:16:51,583 --> 00:16:53,417
a minute, Rarity?

533
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:54,625
Certainly.

534
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:59,542
Now, why's it gonna

535
00:16:56,792 --> 00:16:59,542
be so terrible?

536
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,625
Because Svengallop was

537
00:16:59,667 --> 00:17:01,625
in charge of everything!

538
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,625
The lights! The

539
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:03,625
visuals! The sound!

540
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,000
Without Svengallop,

541
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,000
I have nothing!

542
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,834
Now, now. don't go

543
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:07,834
gettin' yourself

544
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:09,917
into a tizzy there, Rara.

545
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,959
Svengallop turned you

546
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,959
into Countess Coloratura

547
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,625
and acted like your friend

548
00:17:13,083 --> 00:17:15,625
so he could enjoy the perks

549
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,208
that came with bein' a star.

550
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,250
But the real perk of friendship

551
00:17:18,792 --> 00:17:20,250
is gettin' to see your friend

552
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,375
bein' true to theirself.

553
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,959
And, Rara, when

554
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,959
you're simply yourself,

555
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,250
you're the brightest star

556
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,250
I've ever seen shine!

557
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:35,208
[cheers]

558
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,792
Good evening, everypony!

559
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,208
Welcome to opening night of The

560
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,208
Helping Hooves Music Festival!

561
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,792
Now it is my great honor

562
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,792
to introduce to you

563
00:17:42,917 --> 00:17:45,834

Countess Coloratura!

566
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:52,667
This song may be familiar, but

567
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:52,667
yet it's totally different.

568
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:55,542
Kind of like me: Rara.

Thank you, everypony!

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,041
When I arrived at the Helping

624
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,041
Hooves Music Festival,

625
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:32,166
I had forgotten

626
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:32,166
who I really was.

627
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,542
But then an old friend reminded

628
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,542
me what real friendship is about

629
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:40,166
and she told me that if

630
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:40,166
I was true to myself,

631
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:42,333
I couldn't go wrong.

632
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:45,667
So, I have a very special
