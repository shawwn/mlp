194
00:06:17,625 --> 00:06:20,208
little bit when you ran off

195
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,750
to Ponyville without

196
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,750
saying goodbye,

197
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:25,417
but it's not like we weren't

198
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:25,417
used to that from you.

199
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,041
Yeah, we didn't

200
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,041
take it personally.

201
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,208
But it's really

202
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,208
good to see you now.

203
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,583
Hey! Anypony up for a

204
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,583
blast from the past?

205
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,917
It's our old science lab!

206
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,208
I have so many great

207
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:47,208
memories of this place.

208
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,500
Remember when Lemon

209
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,500
Hearts got her head stuck

210
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,000
in that beaker?

211
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:54,417
[laughter]

212
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:57,959
[chattering]

213
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,500
...but according to this book,

214
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:05,583
you're supposed to add the

215
00:07:02,542 --> 00:07:05,583
sodium chloride first.

216
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,333
I read ahead and to

217
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:08,333
make a proper salt lick,

218
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,792
you need to add

219
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:10,792
the molasses first.

220
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,709
Well, I read ahead

221
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,709
too, Moondancer,

222
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,959
and I'm sure it said

223
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,959
sodium chloride first.

224
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,750
Oh, I've got the wrong

225
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,750
book. That's so hilarious.

226
00:07:26,166 --> 00:07:28,000
Whatever happened to Moondancer?

227
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,166
Moondancer?

228
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,750
Yeah, you know,

229
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,750
our other friend.

230
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:36,291
Oh right, Moondancer!

231
00:07:31,792 --> 00:07:36,291
I remember her!

232
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,041
I wonder what she's up to.

233
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,583
Yeah, I always liked her.

234
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,375
We just sort of lost

235
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,375
touch after you left.

236
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:46,667
I think she went to live out

237
00:07:43,417 --> 00:07:46,667
by the stadium, didn't she?

238
00:07:46,709 --> 00:07:48,000
Well, let's go see!

239
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,709
I think this is the place.

240
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,166
Didn't used to look

241
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,166
like this, though.

242
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:04,667
[knock knock knock]

243
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,500
[knock knock smash]

244
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:11,208
[gasp]

245
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,458
[creak]

246
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:17,500
Moondancer?

247
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:20,542
What do you want?

248
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:20,542
I'm trying to study.

249
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,000
It's us! Your old friends--

250
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,166
Ugh!

251
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,250
[slam]

252
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,792
[laugh]

253
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,959
That's old

254
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,959
Moondancer, all right.

255
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,208
She always did like her books.

256
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,625
Hey, kinda like you

257
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,625
used to be, huh?

258
00:08:37,667 --> 00:08:39,583
Exactly how I used to be.

259
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:59,166
Come on, Twilight, we've been

260
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:59,166
watching her for three days.

261
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,917
Library, house. Library,

262
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:02,917
house. That's it.

263
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,959
Nopony looks at

264
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,959
her or says hello

265
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,667
or even gives her a smile.

266
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,542
It's like she

267
00:09:06,709 --> 00:09:08,542
doesn't even exist.

268
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:10,125
Was she always like this?

269
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,917
Well, she always

270
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,917
was a little shy.

271
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,792
But for a while there she

272
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:13,792
was really starting to

273
00:09:13,834 --> 00:09:15,125
come out of her shell.

274
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,959
Remember when she

275
00:09:15,166 --> 00:09:16,959
threw that party?

276
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,208
Oh,right. I think you might

277
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:22,208
have been busy that day.

278
00:09:26,583 --> 00:09:28,417
There you are, Twilight!

279
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,709
Moondancer is having

280
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,709
a little get-together

281
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,208
in the west castle

282
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:33,208
courtyard. You wanna come?

283
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,709
Ooh, sorry girls. I got a lot

284
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,709
of studying to catch up on.

285
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,834
Thought she might finally

286
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,834
be letting her guard down

287
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,667
a little with that party.

288
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:52,083
We invited her out a

289
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:52,083
few times after that,

290
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,667
but she was always

291
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,667
too busy studying.

292
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,458
So eventually we

293
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:57,458
just stopped asking.

294
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,250
I had no idea that party

295
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,250
was so important to her.

296
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,041
I've got to find a way

297
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:05,041
to make it up to her.

298
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,875
Oh my gosh! Moondancer? Is that?

299
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,291
SSSSSHHHHH!

300
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,542
Moondancer? Can I talk

301
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:34,542
to you for a min--

302
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,625
SSSSSHHH!

303
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,625
What is this?

304
00:10:40,667 --> 00:10:42,458
Uh, a bubble of silence.

305
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,792
I haven't seen

306
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,792
you in a while

307
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,917
and I thought it might

308
00:10:43,834 --> 00:10:45,917
be nice to catch up.

309
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,083
For what purpose?

310
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,250
You know. Cause we're friends.

311
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,125
[pop]

312
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,208
SSSSSHHHHH!

313
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,583
I'm really sorry to bother you.

314
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,500
I was just hoping we could go

315
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:05,500
outside and talk for a bit.

316
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,458
I'm sorry I skipped your party.

317
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,375
AAH!

318
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:17,583
SSSSSHHHHH!

319
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,875
Why won't you leave me

320
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:22,875
alone? I'm trying to study!

321
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:26,000
You've got the wrong pony.

322
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:26,000
I don't have parties.

323
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,291
You did once.

324
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,166
And I was so caught

325
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:29,166
up in my own studying

326
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,166
that I didn't take your

327
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,166
feelings into account.

328
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:32,792
Look, Twilight Twinkle--

329
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:34,125
Sparkle.

330
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,458
Whatever. I just need to be

331
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,458
alone so I can study

332
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,750
without some crazy pony trying

333
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,750
to make friends, all right?

334
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:41,125
Fine.

335
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,250
Wait.

336
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,750
How did you get into

337
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,750
my book like that?

338
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,417
I've been studying a

339
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,417
new studying technique.

340
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,083
I can only do it

341
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,083
for a few minutes,

342
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,959
but you'd be amazed how

343
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,959
much you can pick up

344
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,917
when you're

345
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,917
actually in a book.

346
00:11:55,959 --> 00:11:57,625
That's one of Haycart's methods.

347
00:11:57,667 --> 00:11:58,834
You know Haycart?

348
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,667
Of course! He's a genius!

349
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,917
I have a copy of his "Treatise

350
00:12:00,709 --> 00:12:02,917
on Ponies," you know.

351
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,333
What is this place?

352
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,917
This is where I used to live.

353
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,917
You mean I never had you over?

354
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,542
A first edition of

355
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,542
"Principles of Magic"!

356
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,834
Hey. Didn't I

357
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,834
give this to you?

358
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,291
Maybe?

359
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,083
I did! Look, I even wrote

360
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:26,083
something:

361
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,375
"To my friend,

362
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,375
Twilight Sparkle.

363
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:31,083
Thanks for introducing

364
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:31,083
me to the classics."

365
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,291
I can see by the fact

366
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,291
that you left it here

367
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,417
that it meant a lot to you.

368
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,083
Look, I didn't

369
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,083
bring you over here

370
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,375
for even more poignant reminders

371
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,375
of what a bad friend I was.

372
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,375
I brought you here

373
00:12:40,417 --> 00:12:42,375
to give you this.

374
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,125
You can come here

375
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:45,125
whenever you want

376
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,125
and study to your

377
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:47,125
heart's content.

378
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,667
Really?

379
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,834
But first you've got

380
00:12:48,709 --> 00:12:51,834
to do something for me.

381
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:53,041
What?

382
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,709
Have dinner with our

383
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,709
old friends tonight.

384
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,750
I can't; I'm reorganizing

385
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:58,750
my biology scrolls.

386
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,375
I've been spending a lot of time

387
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,375
with Minuette, Twinkleshine,

388
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:04,333
and Lemon Hearts since I've been

389
00:13:01,417 --> 00:13:04,333
back. They really miss you.

390
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,291
Look, I already told you,

391
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:07,291
the last thing I need

392
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,959
is a bunch of ridiculous

393
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,959
friend-making

394
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,583
keeping me from studying.

395
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,625
Moondancer, wait!

396
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,208
A wise pony once taught me

397
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,625
that there's more to life

398
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,625
than dusty old books.

399
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:20,041
I tried friendship and

400
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:20,041
it's just not for me.

401
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,625
Now if you'll excuse me.

402
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:27,792
What if I taught you

403
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:27,792
Haycart's method?

404
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,792
So, uh, what are you

405
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,792
studying these days?

406
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:38,417
Science. Magic. History.

407
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:38,417
Economics. Pottery.

408
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:39,875
Things like that.

409
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:43,208
Yowza! You plannin' on being

410
00:13:39,917 --> 00:13:43,208
a professor or something?

411
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,750
No.

412
00:13:44,792 --> 00:13:47,458
So you're just...studying?

413
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,542
Can I go now?

414
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,041
Moondancer, please.

415
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,417
It's all right, Twilight.

416
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,208
We're having a good

417
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:54,208
time. Right, everypony?

418
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,875
So, uh,Spike, tell

419
00:13:57,625 --> 00:14:00,875
Moondancer that story about

420
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:04,875
how Twilight had to read a

421
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:04,875
book about doing a sleepover.

422
00:14:04,917 --> 00:14:06,834
"Slumber 101"? I've read that.

423
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,959
Oh, heh-heh, really?

424
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,959
Well, uh, did you know

425
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,250
Lemon Hearts here works

426
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,250
at the Canterlot palace?

427
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,542
Yeah, it's true. I do

428
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:17,542
the big events, mostly.

429
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,792
State dinners, that

430
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,792
sort of thing.

431
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:23,625
[nervous titters]

432
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,083
Ugh!

433
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:37,000
Moondancer! You've got to

434
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:37,000
give friendship a chance!

435
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,959
I gave friendship a

436
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,959
chance a long time ago.

437
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,500
It didn't work out then. It

438
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,500
isn't going to work out now.

439
00:14:43,542 --> 00:14:45,750
Twilight? Are you all right?

440
00:14:47,417 --> 00:14:49,750
No. No, I'm not.

441
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,709
Where are you going?

442
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,834
I don't know, Spike, I really

443
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,834
messed this one up.

444
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,125
That party was

445
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,125
everything to her.

446
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,083
I can only imagine what

447
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,083
it must have felt like

448
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,834
when I didn't show up.

449
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:11,375
Hey, Moondancer! Look

450
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:11,375
at this spread, huh?

451
00:15:11,417 --> 00:15:13,250
Thank you so much for coming!

452
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:17,667
Of course! We wouldn't miss one

453
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:17,667
of our best friend's parties!

454
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,250
Is Twilight coming?

455
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:28,166
Oh. OK.

456
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,500
Hey, we'll still

457
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:31,500
have fun, right?

458
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,291
Sure.

459
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,542
If there was only a

460
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,542
way to undo the damage.

461
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:47,792
I know what I need to do.

462
00:15:47,834 --> 00:15:49,834
And I know just who can help me!

463
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,875
Huh. Guess they must have

464
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,875
gone back to Ponyville.

465
00:16:07,917 --> 00:16:11,709
Wheeee!

466
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,834
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

467
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,375
[crash]

468
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:21,166
That was AWESOME! We gotta go

469
00:16:16,417 --> 00:16:21,166
flying more often, Twilight!

470
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,583
There you are!

471
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,500
I thought you threw in the

472
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:25,500
ol' towel and headed home!

473
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,333
I did head home, but not

474
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:28,333
to throw in the towel.

475
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,959
I went to get my secret

476
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:31,959
weapon. Minuette, meet--

477
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,959
Hey, Pinkie Pie!

478
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,166
Hi, Minuette!

479
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,875
Twilight, you didn't say

480
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:39,875
Minuette would be here!

481
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:41,542
You two know each other?

482
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,375
Oh, sure! She was one of

483
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,375
Cadance's bridesmaids.

484
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,500
We hang out all the time

485
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:46,500
when she's in Ponyville.

486
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:47,959
Didn't you know that?

487
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,583
Hah! And you call yourself

488
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,583
the Princess of Friendship!

489
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,208
Twilight briefed me

490
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:54,208
on the way here.

491
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,417
We'll need fifteen

492
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,417
bags of confetti

493
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,792
and as many hooves

494
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:56,792
as we can get.

495
00:16:56,834 --> 00:17:00,250
Let's go! We can pass by

496
00:16:56,834 --> 00:17:00,250
the donut place on the way.

497
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,834
And what are we gonna do?

498
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,959
Just come with me.

499
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:15,333
Oooh, "A Brief History

500
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:15,333
of the Wagon Harness"!

501
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,583
"The Life and Times of

502
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,583
Marwari the Maneless"?

503
00:17:35,667 --> 00:17:36,667
[gasp]

504
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,125
What is this?

505
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,959
It's a party. For you.

506
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:47,834
SURPRISE!

507
00:17:49,917 --> 00:17:51,417
Come on in!

508
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,291
Uh, thanks, but no thanks.

509
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:54,291
I don't do parties.

510
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,291
I know. And I think

511
00:17:57,667 --> 00:18:00,291
it's my fault.

512
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
Back when we were

513
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:02,000
in school together,

514
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:03,875
you invited me to a party.

515
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,792
I was so focused on my

516
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:06,792
studies that I didn't show up.

517
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:08,417
Big deal.

518
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,875
It was a big deal.

519
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:12,625
And now that I realize how

520
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:12,625
important friendship is,

521
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,500
I'd like to make up for my

522
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:15,500
mistake with a new party.

523
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,041
A party in honor of

524
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,041
my friend, Moondancer.

525
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,291
Please, you've got to let

526
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:24,291
me make this up to you.

527
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,041
And you think this is

528
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:29,041
going to do it, huh?

529
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,291
Yes?

530
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,583
Well, sure, why wouldn't it?

531
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,083
That was only the first time I

532
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:36,083
ever put myself out there

533
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,959
and then you didn't

534
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,959
even bother to show up.

535
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,083
Then you left town

536
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,083
without saying goodbye,

537
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,458
even though we were

538
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,458
supposed to be friends.

539
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,667
I was humiliated! I felt

540
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,667
like I wasn't important!

541
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,250
I never wanted to let myself

542
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:51,250
be hurt like that again!

543
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,834
Those three finally convinced

544
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,834
me that I had value!

545
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,083
That other ponies might like

546
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,083
me and want to be my friend!

547
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,041
And YOU! DIDN'T! SHOW! UP!

548
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:07,250
[sobbing]

549
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:08,417
[whispering]

550
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,875
You're right; this party can't

551
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,875
make up for the way I hurt you.

552
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:19,417
But please, don't let my

553
00:19:16,917 --> 00:19:19,417
mistake be the reason

554
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,625
you can't be friends

555
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,625
with anypony else.

556
00:19:24,917 --> 00:19:26,250
We were your friends then

557
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,834
and we'd be honored

558
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:28,834
to be your friends now.

559
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:43,583
What? That's the librarian,

560
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:43,583
the book seller, my sister!

561
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,417
You've got a lot of

562
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:46,417
friends, Moondancer.

563
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,250
I'm sorry, Moondancer.

564
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,500
I've faced magical creatures,

565
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,500
the end of Equestria...

566
00:19:53,542 --> 00:19:55,375
all sorts of things.

567
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:58,500
But seeing how my

568
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:58,500
actions affected you,

569
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,250
that was one of the worst

570
00:19:58,542 --> 00:20:01,250
feelings I've ever had.

571
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,583
Thank you, Twilight.

572
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,458
I never realized how much

573
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:10,458
I needed to hear that.
