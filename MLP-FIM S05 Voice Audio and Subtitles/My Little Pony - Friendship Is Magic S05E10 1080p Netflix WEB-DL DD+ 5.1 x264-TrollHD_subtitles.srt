00:06:23,208 --> 00:06:26,709
deserves a little reward.

198
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,375
Princess Spike. Heh-heh!

199
00:06:29,417 --> 00:06:30,625
[slurp]

200
00:06:30,667 --> 00:06:32,375
[arguing]

201
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:36,625
All right, I worked

202
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:36,625
forever on this thing.

203
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:38,792
Uh, hi, can I help you?

204
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,750
My friend here, the

205
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:40,750
distinguished pony

206
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:43,959
from up Manehattan and I are

207
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:43,959
in a bit of a pickle,

208
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,208
and we need the Princess

209
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,208
Twilight to resolve it.

210
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,500
Can you talk a little quieter?

211
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,500
And maybe come back later?

212
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,291
Oh, sure now, gosh,

213
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:52,291
I wish we could,

214
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,250
but uh, we're both

215
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,250
supposed to give speeches

216
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,834
about our local economies

217
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,834
in five minutes.

218
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,000
And we've been booked

219
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,000
in the same hall.

220
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,041
I had the room first,

221
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:01,041
and let's be honest,

222
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:03,000
my speech is more important.

223
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,333
Point of order there, sir,

224
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,333
but I think you'll find

225
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,917
that my speech is the more

226
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:08,917
important one, dontcha know.

227
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,750
Look, youse is gonna have

228
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:11,750
a lot of unhappy delegates

229
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,667
on your hooves unless

230
00:07:11,792 --> 00:07:13,667
we get a ruling

231
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,709
from Princess

232
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,709
Twilight right now.

233
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:23,417
[sigh] Let me see what I can do.

234
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:33,125
[light snoring]

235
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,250
Huh? Does something

236
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,250
need scheduling?

237
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh, uh, yeah.

238
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,291
Two delegates have speeches

239
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,291
booked in the same hall.

240
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:43,583
What do I do?

241
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:44,917
OK, no problem.

242
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,083
Just put the hay in the

243
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,083
apple and eat the candle.

244
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,291
Huh?

245
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,583
[sigh]

246
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,417
I need an answer!

247
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,417
But Twilight can't

248
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:55,417
even think straight.

249
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,917
Oh my gosh! What am

250
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:57,917
I supposed to do?

251
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,417
Well? What did she say?

252
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,667
She picked me, right?

253
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:07,792
Hey hey hey!

254
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,291
Let's not be too

255
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:10,291
hasty there, good sir.

256
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,291
I got a feeling

257
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,291
she went with me.

258
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,291
Hey, hey if she

259
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:14,291
didn't pick me,

260
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,834
it ain't hard to see that as an

261
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:17,834
insult to all of Manehattan.

262
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:19,000
You know what I'm sayin'?

263
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,000
And it'd sure be a

264
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,000
shame to see something

265
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,291
like a scheduling issue

266
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,291
create a nasty old rift

267
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,583
between Whinnyapolis

268
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:25,583
and Ponyville.

269
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,458
So? What did the

270
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:28,458
Princess say?

271
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,583
Come on now,

272
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,583
spit it out!

273
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,834
Ummm, she said that,

274
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:34,834
well, she said, that she,

275
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,959
she wants you to ... share it?

276
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,792
If that's what the Princess

277
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,792
wants, what are you gonna do?

278
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,542
The Princess is always right.

279
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,458
No hard feelings; this

280
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:47,458
is not about you and me.

281
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,750
And now back to more

282
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:52,750
important things.

283
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,709
Combining those two

284
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:00,709
talks was a disaster!

285
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,125
The hall was overcrowded

286
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,166
and the speakers just

287
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,166
shouted over each other!

288
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,500
Huh? But--

289
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,792
Why would the Princess

290
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:07,792
have made such a decision?

291
00:09:07,834 --> 00:09:10,709
[angry buzz of conversation]

292
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,959
Spike: Uh-oh.

293
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,375
[buzz continues]

294
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:19,166
Uh, by order of Princess

295
00:09:15,417 --> 00:09:19,166
Twilight...be quiet!

296
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,583
[silence]

297
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,458
I was really looking forward

298
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,875
to the "Don't Spend

299
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,875
All Your Bits" speech,

300
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:32,083
but when I went into the

301
00:09:27,917 --> 00:09:32,083
hall, a pony had taken my seat.

302
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:35,500
A pony who used to be my friend!

303
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,542
Your friend took

304
00:09:35,542 --> 00:09:38,542
your seat? Big deal.

305
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:40,083
Why don't you just--

306
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,417
No offense, but I don't need

307
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,417
some random dragon's opinion.

308
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,709
I want to hear what

309
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:45,709
Princess Twilight thinks.

310
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,125
Ugh. Fine.

311
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,041
[snoring]

312
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,917
Uh, the Princess says no

313
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,917
friendship should end

314
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,250
over a seat.

315
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,166
You should forgive your friend.

316
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:04,166
Of course! Oh, the

317
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:04,166
Princess is so wise!

318
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,375
I could tell these

319
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,375
delegates anything

320
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,458
as long as they think it

321
00:10:08,417 --> 00:10:10,458
came from Twilight.

322
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,750
All right, who's next?

323
00:10:14,792 --> 00:10:21,792
♪♪

324
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:59,125
So how can Princess

325
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:59,125
Twilight be of service?

326
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,291
Well! As host city, the

327
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:02,291
Canterlot delegation

328
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,291
feels it's only right

329
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,291
that we should get passes

330
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,959
to every meeting

331
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,959
and party, yes?

332
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,458
Well, that's doesn't seem fair.

333
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,291
I mean, Princess Twilight

334
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,291
doesn't think that seems fair.

335
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,125
Yes, yes, very well.

336
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,667
It was worth a try,

337
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,667
though, wasn't it old chap?

338
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,417
This is great!

339
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,625
I just took care of a

340
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,625
whole bunch of stuff

341
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,041
that Twilight won't have to

342
00:11:24,667 --> 00:11:27,041
worry about when she wakes up!

343
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,333
Wonder if anypony else

344
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,333
needs the Princess's help.

345
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,834
If I can check a few

346
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,834
of these meetings

347
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,041
off Twilight's schedule,

348
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,583
then when she wakes up,

349
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,792
she won't have to think about

350
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,792
anything but the reception.

351
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,917
Uh, says here you have a

352
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,917
meeting with Princess Twilight?

353
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,458
Yuppers. She wanted

354
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:55,458
me to prep her on all the

355
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,792
different gemstones in the

356
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,792
Citizens of Equestria statue

357
00:11:58,834 --> 00:12:00,750
before the reception tonight.

358
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:02,458
OK. Go ahead.

359
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Um, well, I'd rather um,

360
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:07,500
tell the Princess directly.

361
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,750
Well, if it helps, you can

362
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:10,750
call me Princess Spike.

363
00:12:13,542 --> 00:12:15,083
No no no! It's all right!

364
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,625
The Princess asked me to take

365
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,625
care of a few things for her.

366
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,500
That's why I came to find you.

367
00:12:20,542 --> 00:12:21,959
If you say so.

368
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,875
The Princess says so.

369
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:27,750
OK, let's start with topaze.

370
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,959
I'm here for your 2:00.

371
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,291
You?

372
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,417
But I'm supposed to be

373
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,417
briefing Princess Twilight

374
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,417
on the progress with

375
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,417
the water main.

376
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:39,208
I speak for the Princess.

377
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,625
Well, uh, can I start

378
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,625
fixing it again?

379
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,125
I'm gettin' a little

380
00:12:41,667 --> 00:12:44,125
worried, to be honest.

381
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,000
Actually, Twilight still needs

382
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,000
her rest and her "no noise"

383
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,583
policy is still in effect

384
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:50,583
for a few more hours. Sorry!

385
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:55,375
Hey Spike, what's going on?

386
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,709
Oh, you know, just settin'

387
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,709
em up and knockin' em down.

388
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,250
What do you mean?

389
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,291
Not only have I kept things

390
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,291
quiet so Twilight could sleep,

391
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,291
I also took care of all her

392
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,291
afternoon meetings

393
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,542
so she won't have to worry

394
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,542
about them when she wakes up.

395
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,166
Are you sure she'd

396
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:11,166
want you doing that?

397
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,834
There are so many things to

398
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,834
keep track of at this Summit.

399
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,208
Ah, don't worry,

400
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,208
I got it covered.

401
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,625
I know Twilight so well, it's

402
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,625
easy to make decisions like her.

403
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:22,041
Oh. OK.

404
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,834
Well, thank you for keeping

405
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,834
Twilight's stress level down...

406
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,291
...as long as that's the

407
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:29,291
real reason you're doing it.

408
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,083
Well, why else

409
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,083
would I be doing it?

410
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,667
You're not enjoying speaking

411
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:35,667
for Twilight a little bit?

412
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:38,291
Enjoying it? Ha ha! No way!

413
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,542
The only things I'm doing

414
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,542
by order of the Princess

415
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,166
are for the good of the Summit.

416
00:13:48,458 --> 00:13:50,291
Heh heh heh heh.

417
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:52,500
[sigh]

418
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,667
By order of the Princess.

419
00:13:59,834 --> 00:14:01,458
By order of the Princess.

420
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,834
By order of the Princess.

421
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,166
Ah. Princess life is good.

422
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:22,250
It sure is. But it's also

423
00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:22,250
hard work, isn't it?

424
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,917
Eh, it's not so bad.

425
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,041
Spike, I'm concerned you might

426
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:27,041
be abusing your relationship

427
00:14:27,083 --> 00:14:28,875
with Twilight.

428
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:31,875
What are you talking about?

429
00:14:28,917 --> 00:14:31,875
I'm a great princess!

430
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,750
I mean, Twilight's

431
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:33,750
a great princess

432
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,709
and I've been working

433
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,709
hard to help her!

434
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,291
When two delegates

435
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,291
had a falling out,

436
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,125
I'm the one who fixed

437
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:39,125
their friendship!

438
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,125
I listened to that pony

439
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,125
drone on about gems

440
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,291
for forty-five minutes so

441
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,291
Twilight wouldn't have to!

442
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,166
I moved a polo match away from

443
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,166
the tower so she could sleep!

444
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,667
And I didn't even eat that

445
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,667
delicious looking statue!

446
00:14:48,709 --> 00:14:50,417
I'm a decision-making master!

447
00:14:52,709 --> 00:14:54,250
[sigh]

448
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:58,083
OK, so maybe I did get a little

449
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:58,083
carried away making decisions.

450
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,875
But it's not like

451
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,875
anything bad happened.

452
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:02,917
[click]

453
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:07,083
[crash]

454
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:09,125
[whoosh]

455
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:10,917
[smash]

456
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,792
Whooooaa!

457
00:15:21,792 --> 00:15:23,834
This is unexpected.

458
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,667
I'll go shut off the main;

459
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,667
you get rid of the water!

460
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,250
[rattling]

461
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:55,000
[whoosh]

462
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,667
At least the statue's OK.

463
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:05,583
[sniff sniff]

464
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,750
Oh no.

465
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh no!

466
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:12,500
Ah...Ah...HACHEW!

467
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:13,792
[smash]

468
00:16:17,709 --> 00:16:19,208
Aw, bless me.

469
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,542
Oh my!

470
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,709
What is the meaning of this?

471
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,834
Well, uh, ya see, there

472
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,834
was this polo game and--

473
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,792
How could you let

474
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,792
a water main burst

475
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,000
on Canterlot's most

476
00:16:36,834 --> 00:16:39,000
important day?

477
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,417
Hey, don't look at me.

478
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,250
Princess Twilight said

479
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:43,250
to stop working on it.

480
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,834
Well, what about these trees?

481
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,834
I ordered them trimmed to

482
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:47,834
avoid just such a situation!

483
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,250
Well, the princess

484
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,250
told me to stop, bub.

485
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,083
Why would the Princess make

486
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:53,083
such horrible decisions?

487
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,834
This all could have

488
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:54,834
been prevented!

489
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,291
[angry shouts]

490
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:58,041
Please! Everypony, listen!

491
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm so sorry all this happened!

492
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:01,709
What are you apologizing for?

493
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,125
These were Princess

494
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,125
Twilight's awful decisions!

495
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,917
I'm about to blow my stack

496
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,917
on Princess Twilight,

497
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,000
I'll tell you that for nothin!

498
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,500
Yeah, me too!

499
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,417
I'll not let Princess Twilight

500
00:17:09,542 --> 00:17:12,417
give Canterlot a bad name

501
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,959
in the eyes of Equestria!

502
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Come on, everypony, let's go

503
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
give her a piece of our mind!

504
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,500
Wait, you've got it all wrong!

505
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:27,542
[shouts]

506
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:30,417
WAIT!

507
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,458
I mean... wait.

508
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,875
What is it now?

509
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,250
There's an angry mob here

510
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:38,250
that demands satisfaction!

511
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,667
It's just that, uh,

512
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,667
we don't want to wake

513
00:17:39,709 --> 00:17:41,667
the Princess, do we?

514
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:43,125
Wake her? What?

515
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,250
You're tellin' me

516
00:17:43,166 --> 00:17:45,250
that she's asleep?

517
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:50,792
[angry shouts]

518
00:17:50,834 --> 00:17:53,333
[panting]

519
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:56,333
Princess! We must speak at once!

520
00:17:56,375 --> 00:18:00,417
SHE... IS...SLEEPING!

521
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:05,959
[snoring]

522
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,083
[sigh]

523
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,250
I'm glad you're here, Spike.

524
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:13,250
We've got a lot to do.

525
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,375
Do you know if the

526
00:18:13,291 --> 00:18:15,375
water main was fixed?

527
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:18,083
Uh, you seem well rested.

528
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,834
I haven't slept like

529
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,834
that since I was a filly.

530
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,875
You haven't?

531
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:24,583
Well, at least I

532
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:24,583
got one thing right.

533
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,458
And it was the one thing

534
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:27,458
Cadance asked of me.

535
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,375
Maybe I did do a good job today.

536
00:18:29,417 --> 00:18:31,792
[banging on door and yelling]

537
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:36,750
Fancy Pants. What's wrong?

538
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,834
Don't play games

539
00:18:36,792 --> 00:18:38,834
with me, Princess.

540
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,375
You know why I'm here!

541
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,834
Is this about the special

542
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,834
privileges you wanted?

543
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,333
Because this seems

544
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,333
a little extreme.

545
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:47,417
Special privileges?

546
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,208
The last thing on my mind

547
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:50,208
is special privileges!

548
00:18:51,333 --> 00:18:53,542
What's going on, Spike?

549
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:56,875
Um...you needed to sleep!

550
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,208
And Princess Cadance told me

551
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:59,208
you weren't to be disturbed!

552
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,583
And there was this bird,

553
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:02,583
and well...long story short,

554
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,792
I made a few decisions

555
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:05,792
on your behalf.

556
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,625
"A few decisions?"

557
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:12,750
Well, maybe more than a few.

558
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:16,709
But I had good

559
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:16,709
intentions. Honest!

560
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,500
Until I didn't anymore.

561
00:19:20,542 --> 00:19:22,083
I'm sorry, Twilight.

562
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,625
I guess I got a

563
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,625
little carried away.

564
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:27,875
It just felt so good to have

565
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:27,875
ponies caring about my opinions

566
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:30,041
on such important matters.

567
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:34,291
I guess I was just enjoying

568
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:34,291
feeling like a princess.

569
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,250
Well, Spike, one of the most

570
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,250
important things a princess

571
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:41,250
can do is realize when she's

572
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:41,250
made a mistake and fix it.

573
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:42,583
How do I do that?

574
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,250
You could start with them.

575
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,834
[sigh] Uh, hi there, everypony.

576
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:55,625
So I guess I owe you all

577
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:55,625
a pretty big apology.

578
