577
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,917
Though I would just

578
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:54,917
like to point out

579
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:59,375
that I was the first

580
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:59,375
to admit I was wrong.

581
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,959
That may be, but I promised

582
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,959
not to fight first.

583
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:03,375
That counts for more.

584
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,583
Oh, yeah?

585
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:10,959
[urgent chirping & chittering]

586
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,834
Oh, all right. We don't

587
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:13,834
have to speak animal

588
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,834
to know what y'all

589
00:20:13,959 --> 00:20:16,834
are sayin'. Truce?

590
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,166
Truce.

591
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:27,625
♪♪

592
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,000
Hoo-wee, ain't that

593
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:39,000
a pretty sight!

594
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:41,375
Sure is.

595
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,250
The McColts are going to

596
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,250
help us rebuild our homes --

597
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,166
good ones this time.

598
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,667
And the Hooffields are going

599
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:49,667
to help us grow some crops.

600
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,458
Not pumpkins!

601
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,041
Thanks for teaching us that

602
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,041
friendship is so much better

603
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,417
than winning a silly argument.

604
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,250
Yay! I told you

605
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:05,250
we'd figure it out.

606
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,291
We did. And we didn't need my

607
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:09,291
friendship portfolio to do it.

608
00:21:09,417 --> 00:21:10,834
We just needed each other.

609
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:12,291
[poof]

610
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,291
So what do you think

611
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:14,291
will happen next?

612
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:16,667
We've all been called

613
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:16,667
by the map now.

614
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:20,041
I'm sure we'll find

615
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:20,041
out when we get home.

616
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,750
What if it summons all six

617
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,750
of us to another place?

618
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,625
Or another pony we

619
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:24,625
weren't expecting? [gasp]

620
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,291
What if it wants us to solve

621
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,291
other kinds of problems like

622
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:31,041
quantum physics or why the apple

623
00:21:27,417 --> 00:21:31,041
doesn't fall far from the tree?
