00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:17,500
Do you reckon it knows

384
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:17,500
any Apple farmin' hunks?

385
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,000
Indeed so.

386
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,834
What does the rock look like?

387
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,375
It looks like

388
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,375
something that formed

389
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:26,709
when volcanic lava

390
00:12:23,417 --> 00:12:26,709
cooled quickly.

391
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,959
Oh.

392
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,750
Have you ever wished you

393
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,750
could turn into a rock?

394
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,834
I had a dream once

395
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,834
I was an apple.

396
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,250
We have a lot in common

397
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,875
when it comes to thinking

398
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:35,875
about turning into things.

399
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,834
Pinkie: FOUND IT!

400
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,834
FOUND IT! FOUND IT!

401
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:49,834
A picture? I been lookin'

402
00:12:45,667 --> 00:12:49,834
for a real stone, Pinkie Pie.

403
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:54,000
Um, that would be weird. Do

404
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:54,000
you know what this means?

405
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,625
I get to raise the flag! And now

406
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:57,625
it's time to hide the presents!

407
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,583
Y'all hide your presents?

408
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,417
Of course! What's more fun

409
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:02,417
than getting a present?

410
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,125
FINDING A PRESENT!

411
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,166
Although most years

412
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:07,166
nopony finds one.

413
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:09,834
So nopony gets presents?

414
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,041
Not usually.

415
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,125
So let me get all this straight.

416
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,291
You're only allowed to

417
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,291
eat Rock Soup for dinner.

418
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,583
Then, the pony who finds this

419
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,583
rock gets to raise the flag,

420
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,000
but not really cause you

421
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,000
don't got no flag pole.

422
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,750
And to top it off, you

423
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:24,750
don't even get presents?

424
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:28,792
Well, it doesn't sound very

425
00:13:24,792 --> 00:13:28,792
fun when you say it THAT way.

426
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:31,041
Well, how about

427
00:13:28,834 --> 00:13:31,041
you picture this:

428
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:36,667
both our families, opening

429
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:36,667
presents, raising the flag...

430
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:39,875
Picturing it, loving it!

431
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,917
Goodnight, everypony!

432
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,375
Goodnight, Pinkie Pie!

433
00:13:50,333 --> 00:13:52,125
We gotta do something, y'all.

434
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,959
Pinkie Pie's family's never

435
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:54,959
had a real Hearth's Warming.

436
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,208
Is that really what she said?

437
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,125
Well, I'm sure it's

438
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:00,125
what she meant.

439
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:01,750
These are their traditions.

440
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,667
Eyup.

441
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,458
I know they have their

442
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:07,458
traditions and we have ours,

443
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,709
but I just want them to see how

444
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,709
much better theirs could be.

445
00:14:13,917 --> 00:14:16,291
[rooster crows]

446
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,750
Hearth's Warming!

447
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,542
Hearth's Warming!

448
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,542
Hearth's Warming!

449
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,166
Hearth's Warming!

450
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:21,166
Hearth's Warming!

451
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,375
Hearth's Warming!

452
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:23,375
Hearth's Wa-

453
00:14:23,417 --> 00:14:25,583
Oh, my, oh my.

454
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:30,000
What. Happened. To. My. Farm.

455
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,667
It's Hearth's

456
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:32,667
Warming, Apple style!

457
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,500
We've been doing

458
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,500
everything your way.

459
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,959
I thought we could

460
00:14:34,542 --> 00:14:36,959
mix it up a bit.

461
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,667
Marble Pie, you could raise the

462
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,667
Equestria flag up this pole,

463
00:14:40,709 --> 00:14:42,625
because you're the youngest Pie.

464
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:46,458
Ma and Pa Pie, we'll cook you up

465
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:46,458
a meal you'll never forget.

466
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
And look, we all get presents

467
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,500
without having to find 'em!

468
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:57,208
Yeah! This is going to be great!

469
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,625
All the stuff she

470
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,625
said. Right, everypony?

471
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:05,625
Pinkamina Diane Pie, truly thou

472
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:05,625
do not favor this madness?

473
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:08,959
Well, I want to

474
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:08,959
be one big family.

475
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,625
But what about

476
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,625
what we usually do?

477
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:17,333
I, um, well? I don't know!

478
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:17,333
Don't make me choose!

479
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,375
I didn't mean to cause a fuss.

480
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,792
Why don't we just open

481
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:21,792
presents around the flagpole.

482
00:15:21,834 --> 00:15:23,750
It'll be fun, you'll see.

483
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:27,500
Excuse me. You planted

484
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:27,500
your pole on a fault line.

485
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:34,542
[crackling]

486
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,125
[crash]

487
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,834
NOOOOOOOO!

488
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,333
[smash]

489
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,750
[sigh] Oh boy.

490
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,291
You didn't have to

491
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:54,291
ask them to leave.

492
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:55,792
They wanted to go.

493
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:58,792
We don't need anypony forcing

494
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:58,792
their way into our family.

495
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,166
This was all a

496
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:01,166
misunderstanding, everypony.

497
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,500
I know Applejack,

498
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:06,250
and she'd never do

499
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:06,250
anything bad to anypony.

500
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,208
Look around, Pinkie Pie.

501
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,583
It's gonna take me ages to get

502
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:11,583
this rock farm back on track.

503
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,792
And how're we gonna

504
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,792
lift Holder's Boulder?

505
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:15,875
This is all her fault.

506
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:17,792
Then it's my fault too.

507
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:24,125
Probably best if we head

508
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:24,125
back to Sweet Apple Acres.

509
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,417
Maybe in time we'll

510
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:27,417
be friends again.

511
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,834
But for the now it's best if

512
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,834
we give them a little space.

513
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:35,041
I wish we didn't have

514
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:35,041
to. I really like Maud.

515
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,291
She's sweet once you get

516
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:38,291
to know her. They all are.

517
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,625
Worst Hearth's Warming ever.

518
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:47,417
Has anypony seen Applejack?

519
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,792
[sobbing]

520
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,917
I really cracked

521
00:16:51,834 --> 00:16:53,917
the corn this time.

522
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,959
I really popped the

523
00:16:55,208 --> 00:16:57,959
piñata this time.

524
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,959
Pinkie Pie?

525
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,792
Ah! What are you

526
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,792
doing here?

527
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,458
What are you

528
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:02,458
doing here?

529
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,166
I came here to think.

530
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,375
You did? So did I!

531
00:17:06,417 --> 00:17:10,041
[laughing]

532
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,250
I'm too ashamed to

533
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,250
go back up there.

534
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,291
Your family, my family?

535
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,041
They all must think

536
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:17,041
I'm such a nincompoop.

537
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:19,709
Aw, no one thinks that.

538
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:26,458
Pushy, aggressive, mean.

539
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:26,458
Oh I'm not helping, sorry.

540
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,208
I'm sorry I forced my

541
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,208
traditions over yours.

542
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,667
I don't want you to have to

543
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,667
choose between the family

544
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:34,917
you were born into, and the

545
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:34,917
friends who love you like one.

546
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:39,291
I really hoped we could be

547
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:39,291
one big family. I guess not.

548
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,625
Don't say that!

549
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,250
[train whistle]

550
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,083
I wish I could stay but

551
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:45,083
I have a train to catch.

552
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:50,625
Hap... hap... happy

553
00:17:46,667 --> 00:17:50,625
Hearth's Warming.

554
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:52,750
You, too.

555
00:17:52,792 --> 00:17:59,792
[rattling train wheels]

556
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:05,417
You wanna know why Holder's

557
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:05,417
Boulder's so dangit important?

558
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,125
Well, now, their great great

559
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,125
great great great grandfather,

560
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:13,208
Holder Cobblestone, he found

561
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:13,208
that boulder in a Dragon's nest,

562
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,291
older than time itself.

563
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,917
He built the family

564
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,917
farm around it,

565
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,417
even though it was just

566
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:20,417
an ordinary rock.

567
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,458
It's always brought

568
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:23,458
them good luck.

569
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,250
Crickets! That is important.

570
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,792
I got so caught up in the

571
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:28,792
things they were doin',

572
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:30,417
