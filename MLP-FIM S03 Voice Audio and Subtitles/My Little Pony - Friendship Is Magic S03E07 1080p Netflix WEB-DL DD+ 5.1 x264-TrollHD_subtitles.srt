you'll be an unstoppable team?

and who we are.

389
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,478
But I think sending her

390
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:50,478
a care package is a great idea.

391
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:52,188
A care package it is.

392
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,232
We'll send it

393
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,232
through the mail.

394
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,526
Wait! Ah!

395
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:56,526
That won't work at all.

396
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,319
Why not?

397
00:12:56,651 --> 00:12:58,319
Because what if the package

398
00:12:58,445 --> 00:12:59,946
gets lost in the mail?

399
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,031
What if somepony else

400
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,031
gets the package by accident

401
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,033
and then she remembers us

402
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,033
instead of Rainbow Dash

403
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,660
and then she becomes

404
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,660
our new friend.

405
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,621
And then the real Rainbow Dash

406
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,621
won't ever know

407
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,123
that she used to have friends

408
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,123
and she forgot them.

409
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,041
Is anypony else

00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:12,041

411
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,419

412
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,419
I've got it!

413
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,547
We'll deliver the care package

414
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,547
to Rainbow Dash in person.

415
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,881
I wouldn't mind

416
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:18,881
a little trip.

417
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,675
I'll go.

418
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,675
Count me in.

419
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,552
Me too.

420
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,552
Me five.

421
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,887
But don't be upset if she

422
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:24,887
doesn't recognize you at first.

423
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,308
It may take a while for her

424
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,308
to get her memory back.

00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,240
The object of this exercise

is to work

And don't worry

00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,163
about winning.

436
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,332
It's not a race.

437
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,085
Now, everypony

It's no good.

00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,533
I can't get around them.

445
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:27,784
It doesn't matter.

446
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,577
We can still fly

447
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,577

448
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:32,330

( thunder rumbling )

00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,715
Why don't you two

472
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,715
go hit the mess hall early?

473
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,717
Yes, ma'am.

the other teams off like that.

Besides, Wonderbolts

are supposed to be able

00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:42,776
They could use the practice.

582
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,962
That's why I'm here,

583
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,962
ma'am.

584
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,297
Lightning Dust decided

585
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,297
to use a tornado.

586
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,466
A bit excessive

587
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,466
for cloudbusting.

588
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,926
But judging from your time,

589
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,719
it was obviously

590
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:38,719
an effective tactic.

591
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,721
Yeah,

592
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:40,721
well, that effective tactic

593
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,431
nearly took out my friends.

594
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,309
No disrespect, ma'am,

595
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,309
but there's a big difference

596
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,311
between pushing yourself

597
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,311
as hard as you can

598
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,229
and just being reckless.

599
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,564
And if being reckless

600
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,150
is what gets rewarded

601
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,150
around here,

602
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,276
if that's what it means

603
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,276
to be a Wonderbolt,

604
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,612
then I don't want any part

605
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,612
of it.

606
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,405
What are you saying, newbie?

607
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,701
I quit.

608
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,336
APPLEJACK:

609
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,336
You did what?

610
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,089
But being a Wonderbolt

611
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,089
was your dream.

612
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,883
Not anymore.

613
00:20:17,008 --> 00:20:18,759
I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash.

614
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,512
I know how much

615
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:21,512
this meant to you.

616
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:25,391
Rainbow Dash.

617
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,185
How dare you

618
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:27,185
storm out of my office

619
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,853
without giving me

620
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,853
a chance to respond.

621
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,437
The Wonderbolts are looking

622
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,356
for the best fliers

623
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,356
in Equestria.

624
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,108
But you were right,

625
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,108
being the best

626
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,194
should never come at the expense

627
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,194
of our fellow ponies.

628
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,779
It's not just

629
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:38,779
about pushing ourselves,

630
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,532
it's about pushing ourselves

631
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,532
in the right direction.

632
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,950
You've shown

633
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,950
that you're capable

634
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:44,577
of doing just that.

635
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,219
You're no wingpony,

636
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:01,219
Rainbow Dash.

637
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,387
You're a leader.

638
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,723
Oh, my, gosh. Oh, my, gosh.

639
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,723
Oh, my, gosh. Oh, my, gosh.

640
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,230
Now get up there

641
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,230
and give me 20.

642
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,107
Yes, ma'am.

643
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,609

644
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:30,330
