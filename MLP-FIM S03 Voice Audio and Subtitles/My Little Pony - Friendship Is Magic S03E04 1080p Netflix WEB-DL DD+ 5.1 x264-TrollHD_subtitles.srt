00:00:03,545 --> 00:00:06,966
( Apple Bloom groaning )

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,385
Oh, what to wear?

3
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:10,385
What to wear?

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,053
Oh, what to wear?

5
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,722
Scoot your boot, Apple Bloom.

6
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,557
It's not like it's

7
00:00:13,848 --> 00:00:15,557
the Harvest Day Parade.

8
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,560
We're just going

9
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:18,560
to the train station.

10
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:21,062
Oh, too casual.

11
00:00:21,188 --> 00:00:22,898
Too summery.

12
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,150
Your cousin isn't gonna care

13
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,150
what you're wearing.

14
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,820
Just pick something.

15
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,655
This is my first time

16
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:29,655
meeting her.

17
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,699
And she's from Manehattan.

18
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,826
I want to make

19
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:33,826
a good impression.

20
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,494
You know what would make

21
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,494
a good impression?

22
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,620
What?

23
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:39,414
Being on time to pick her up!

24
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,083
Ah...

25
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,919
( Apple Bloom groans )

26
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,505
You got nothing to worry about,

27
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,505
sugar cube.

28
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,382
Y'all are gonna

29
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,382
get along great.

30
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,800
You already have

31
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,800
something in common.

32
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,760
Oh, yeah?

33
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:51,760
What's that?

34
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,762
Neither of you have

35
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,762
your Cutie Mark.

36
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:58,017
What?! How could you forget to

37
00:00:53,888 --> 00:00:58,017
tell me something like that?

38
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,978
Well, I--

39
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,978
Oh, this changes everything.

40
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,646
Meet you at

41
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,646
the train station.

42
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,899
I gotta tell Sweetie Belle

43
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,899
and Scootaloo.

44
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,151
You know your cousin

45
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,151

You really think

67
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,240
she'll want to join?

68
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,200
She doesn't have

00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,200
her Cutie Mark.

70
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:59,995
Of course she'll want to join

the Cutie Mark Crusaders.

72
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,205
I'm just so excited

73
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,205
I could burst.

( train whistles )

75
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,417
Is that the train

76
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:05,417
from Manehattan?

77
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,044
Yep.

78
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,425
That's her! Oh, wait,

79
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,425
no, no, that's not her.

80
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,302
Oh, wait. No, that's her.

81
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:17,554
Um, no. Wait.

82
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:20,307
That's not her either.

83
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,019
Apple Bloom, you've never

84
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:24,019
met Babs Seed, remember?

85
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,897
Oh, heh-heh, yeah.

86
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,608
Ah, that's her.

87
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,234
Babs! Babs!

88
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,320
It's me, your cousin,

89
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,320
Apple Bloom.

90
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,363
And this is Sweetie Belle.

91
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,363
And this is Scootaloo.

92
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,325

00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,833
Seriously, we are

99
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,833

SWEETIE BELLE:

102
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,294
The Summer Harvest Parade

103
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:50,462
is going on while you're here.

104
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,089
We get to ride in a float.

105
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,008
Really? I've never been

106
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,008
on a float before.

107
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,426
And we've got a really big

108
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:56,426
surprise for you.

109
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,763
Yeah. Uh, a surprise?

110
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,265
APPLE BLOOM:

111
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,265
I give you...

112
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,935
...the Cutie Mark Crusaders

113
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,935
Clubhouse.

114
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,271
BABS:

115
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,271
The Cutie Mark Crusaders?

116
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,900
A club devoted to helping ponies

117
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:11,900
get their Cutie Marks.

118
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,530
We're its founding members.

119
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,907
Technically,

120
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,907
we're its only members.

121
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,492
But we're always

122
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,492
looking to expand

123
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,870
and you seem like

124
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,870
the perfect candidate.

125
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:25,039
I do?

126
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:25,039
Well, yeah.

127
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,082
Since you don't have

128
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:27,082
a Cutie Mark and all.

129
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,002
Oh. Yeah. That.

130
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,295
Allow me to show you just

131
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,295
some of the highlights

132
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,423
of our clubhouse, should

133
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,423
you choose to join us.

134
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,806
This is where

135
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,806
we do our roll call.

136
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,307
Huh.

137
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,563
APPLE BLOOM:

138
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,563
This is where

139
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,563
we eat our lunch.

140
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,320
Sometimes we stand here

141
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:57,320
and think up great ideas.

142
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,034
Yeah. Uh...

143
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,038
Uh, could you excuse us

144
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:06,038
for a moment?

145
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,956
Sure.

146
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,875
Thought she'd be

147
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:09,875
more impressed.

148
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,459
She's from Manehattan.

149
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,588
If we want to impress her

150
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:14,588
we need to really wow her.

151
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,174
ALL:

152
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,174
Hmm...

153
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,051
Ah! The float.

154
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,386
She can ride with us on our

155
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:21,386
Summer Harvest Parade float.

156
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,138
That's perfect.

157
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,974
This really is a good spot

158
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,974
for thinking up great ideas.

159
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,601
ALL:

160
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,601
Mm-hm.

161
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,771
APPLE BLOOM:

162
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:30,771
Here it is.

163
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,023
The official Cutie Mark

164
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:33,023
Crusaders float

165
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,026
for the Summer

166
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,026
Harvest Parade.

167
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,070
As a member of

168
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,070
the Cutie Mark Crusaders

169
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,863
you'd be able to ride

170
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:39,863
on it with us.

171
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,074
It'd be totally fun.

172
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,158
Uh...

173
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,993
More like funny...

174
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,579
BOTH:

175
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,579
Looking! Ha-ha-ha!

176
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,251
What is that thing?

177
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:52,251
A giant orange?

178
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,796
( both laugh )

179
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,796
It's a pumpkin.

180
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:59,382
More like a lame-kin.

181
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:01,509
( laughs )

182
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:05,973
Who's the new blank flank?

183
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,058
She's my cousin, Babs.

184
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,269
She's from Manehattan.

185
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,229
Manehattan, huh?

186
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,274
Well, I guess you have

187
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,274
that going for you.

188
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,859
Suppose you're gonna join

189
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,859
their little club?

190
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,905
What's it called?

191
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,905
The Cutie Mark Crusaders.

192
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,532
(<i> tense theme playing</i> )

193
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:28,870
( puffs air )

194
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,414
More like

195
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,414
the Cutie Mark Crybabies.

Oh, why does life

586
00:18:48,753 --> 00:18:50,588
trying to say is...

587
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,049

00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,221

kept on saying.

598
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,942
