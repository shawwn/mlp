00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,964
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:

2
00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,964
You wanted to see me?

3
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:06,256
To give me a test?

4
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,258
CELESTIA:

5
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,258
The Crystal Empire has returned.

6
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,428
You want me to help protect

7
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:11,428
an entire empire?

8
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,014
It must be you

9
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,014
and you alone.

10
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,141
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:

11
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,141
<i>But what if I fail?</i>

12
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,977
Let's just say the empire.

13
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,103
It isn't the only thing

14
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,103
that's returned.

15
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,606
Go! Go!

16
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:25,400
Sparkle-rific!

17
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,027
Well, with Cadence,

18
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,027
putting all our strength

19
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,863
into keeping the spell going,

20
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:31,907
and me trying to keep an eye on

21
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:31,907
signs of trouble in the Arctic,

22
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,492
we haven't been able

23
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,492
to gather much information

24
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,076
from the Crystal Ponies.

25
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:36,411
There are Crystal Ponies?

26
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,872
I wish I could help you.

27
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,207
But I can't seem

28
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,207
to remember anything

29
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,583
before King Sombra

30
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:41,583
came to power.

31
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,420
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:

32
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,420
<i>History of the Crystal Empire.</i>

33
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,506
The last page of the book

34
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:47,506
mentioned the Crystal Heart

35
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,257
as the faire centerpiece.

36
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,969
So I used my magic to cut

37
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,969
one out of the crystal block.

38
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,470
The whole purpose

39
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:53,470
of the Crystal Faire

40
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,015
is to lift the spirits

41
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:56,015
of the Crystal Ponies

42
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,141
so the lights within them

43
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,141
can power the Crystal Heart,

44
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,560
so that the empire

45
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,560
can be protected.

46
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:01,896
I think we may have a problem.

47
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,981
I didn't know

48
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,981
it was an actual relic.

49
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:06,274
It's all right, Twilight.

50
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,609
( creature howling distantly )

51
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,609

The empire is under attack.

75
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:12,382
( roars )

76
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,268
I have to find

77
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:23,268
the Crystal Heart.

78
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,437
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:

79
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:25,437
No. You stay here with Cadence.

80
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,315
She needs you,

81
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,315
Shining Armor.

82
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,608
I'll retrieve the heart.

83
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,318
Let's do this!

84
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,236
I've been trying to figure out

85
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,236
how I'm meant

86
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,655
to pass

87
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,655
Celestia's test.

88
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,991
Retrieving the Crystal Heart

89
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,991
must be it.

90
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,492
But there is something

91
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:38,492
else you can do.

92
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,702
Name it.

93
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,702
You and the rest of our friends

94
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,412
have to keep

95
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:42,412
the faire going.

96
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:46,041
What? With that thing

97
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:46,041
moving into the empire?

98
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,584
The whole purpose

99
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,584
of the Crystal Faire

100
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,711
is to lift the spirits

101
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,711
of the Crystal Ponies

102
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,338
so they can activate

103
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,338
the Crystal Heart.

104
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:53,048
Yeah? And?

105
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,258
If the Crystal Ponies

106
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,258
find out that King Sombra

107
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,260
is trying to take over

108
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:57,260
the empire again,

109
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,763
their spirits are going to be

110
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,763
anything but lifted.

111
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,642
It won't matter if I find

112
00:03:01,807 --> 00:03:03,642
the Crystal Heart.

113
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,268
They won't be able

114
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:05,268
to make it work.

115
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,688
You have to keep them

116
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,688
happy here at the faire.

117
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:09,356
Keep the faire going

118
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,441
and the Crystal Ponies'

119
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,441
spirits high.

120
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:13,485
Done and done.

121
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,695
SHINING ARMOR:

122
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,695
Twily...

123
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,280
Be careful.

124
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,280
I will.

125
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,122
( croaking )

126
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,337
( calliope music playing )

127
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,808
Okay, here's...

128
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,434
( whispering inaudibly )

129
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,728
Huh?

130
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,440
I just found out

131
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,440
they're offering face-painting

132
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,401
for the little ones.

133
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,401
Ha-ha.

134
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,322
( whispers )

135
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,322
Uh-huh, we can do that.

136
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:02,325
Twilight's doing what?

137
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,039
He really loves

138
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,039
getting his face painted.

139
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:08,415
Ha-ha.

140
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,376
Who wants a flugelhorn?

141
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,088
I want a flugelhorn.

142
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,048
Who else wants

143
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:16,048
a flugelhorn?

144
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:18,550
I want a flugelhorn!

145
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,597
SPIKE:

146
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,597
Twilight! Wait!

147
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:25,348
I'm coming with you.

148
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,725
You can't.

149
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,228
I have to retrieve

150
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,228
the Crystal Heart by myself.

151
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,812
I know.

152
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,732
I promise I won't lift

153
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,732
a claw to help you.

154
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,444
Not a claw, Spike.

155
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,363
SPIKE:

156
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,363
Where are we going exactly?

157
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,573
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:

158
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,573
I think I might know where

159
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,366
King Sombra hid

160
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,366
the Crystal Heart.

161
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,785
SPIKE:

162
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,785
The castle?

163
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,536
The king would have been

164
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,536
counting on the fact

165
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,705
that no pony would dare

166
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:48,705
come looking for it here.

167
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,791
They'd have been too afraid

168
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,791
to even try.

169
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,876
SPIKE:

170
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,876
I hope you're right.

171
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,836
You and me both.

172
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:07,057
What're you looking at?

173
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:09,392
That's what I thought.

174
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,228
Uh, Rainbow Dash?

175
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,772
We're supposed to be acting

176
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,772
like nothing's wrong.

177
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,565
Exactly.

178
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,402
APPLEJACK:

179
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,402
What I mean is...

180
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,404
Maybe you should let me keep

181
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,404
the Crystal Ponies

182
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,739
away from the fake heart

183
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,700
while you show off

184
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,700
your jousting skills.

185
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,828
Seeing my awesomeness

186
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,828
does have a way

187
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,248
of putting ponies

188
00:05:27,953 --> 00:05:31,248
into a pretty good mood.

189
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,418
( sheep bleating )

190
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,258
Come on, Knight Fluttershy.

191
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,302
Huh?

192
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,302
It's showtime.

193
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,471
How y'all feeling?

194
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,471
Having a good time?

195
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,556
The best I've had

196
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,556
in over a thousand years.

197
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:50,433
Well, that's good.

198
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,519
Got to renew that spirit

199
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,519

200
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,189
if you're gonna power up

201
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,189
that Crystal Heart, right?

202
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,691
I sure would like

203
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,691
to see it before the ceremony.

204
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:01,278

208
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,531

209
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,285
Bet you'd like to cool off with

210
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:08,285
a little Crystal Empire nectar.

211
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,458
Uh, you tried

212
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,458
the Crystal Empire fritters yet?

213
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,836
Made from a traditional

214
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,836

215
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,463
You're gonna love them.

216
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,217
Uh, I hear there's

217
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,217
a jousting match about to start.

218
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:25,886
You don't wanna miss that.

219
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:27,762
Come on, Twilight.

220
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,765
These Crystal Ponies are more

221
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:30,765
curious than a cat.

226
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,733
somewhere.

227
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:41,735
It's just got to be.

228
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,572
Not a claw, Spike.

CELESTIA:

233

<i>If the Empire is filled</i>

234

If hatred and fear

238
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:05,508

239
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,513
Of course!

00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,934
No.

243
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:16,770

248
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,025
It is. But it didn't

249

When did you learn to do that?

254
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,587
That was a little trick

255
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:42,587

Not yet.

It's not good.

275
00:08:37,434 --> 00:08:39,853
Cadence's magic must be fading

And now you must go.

It doesn't matter to me.

The test?

299

to stay up there

00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,829

00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,706
so I came down here,

No! I don't want to go.

00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,480
that goes on forever?

393
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,362
Hold on to me.

394
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,907
Uh...

395
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:04,367
Whoa.

396
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,081
Whoa! Yah!

397
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,384
( ponies whimpering )

398
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,764
RARITY:

399
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,764
Excuse me. Pardon me.

400
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,890
I am running out

401
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,890
of weaving materials

402
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,768
for the traditional

403
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,768
crafts booth.

404
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,603
I just made a hat

405
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,603
out of three pieces of hay

406
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,146
and a drinking straw.

407
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,398
I made it work, but still.

408
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,193
We gotta do everything we can

409
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:39,193
to keep this thing going.

410
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,070
The princess isn't looking

411
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,070
so good.

412
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,407
I can't imagine her magic

413
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,407
is gonna last much longer.

414
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,200
It's gonna be fine.

415
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,202
These ponies are gonna power up

416
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,202
that Crystal Heart

417
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,912
when the time comes,

418
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,706
and we won't be needing

419
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,706
her magic anyway.

420
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,750
PINKIE PIE:

421
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,750
I sure hope that time

422
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,750
comes soon.

423
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,294
Even I can't keep this party

424
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,294
going forever.

425
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:58,755
Whoa!

426
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,058
This isn't

427
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,058
the Crystal Heart.

428
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:14,187
Oh, of course it isn't.

429
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,230
The real one is--

430
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,230
On its way.

431
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,233
I was going to say

432
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,233
"being polished"

433
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,069
to buy us some more time.

434
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,069
Oops.

435
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:24,947
( King Sombra cackling )

436
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,157
It's him.

437
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,035
KING SOMBRA:

438
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,035
Crystal heart...

439
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,453
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:

440
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,453
Whoa!

441
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,954
( laughing )

442
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,998
I actually studied

443
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,998
gravity spells

444
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,834
thinking it might be

445
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,834
on my test.

446
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,461
Turns out,

447
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,461
I was prepared for this!

448
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:39,838
Wooo-hoo!

449
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,172
( laughs )

450
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,979
( alarm sounds )

451
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,272
( growls )

452
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,155
( evil laugh )

453
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,326
( thunder crashing )

454
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:10,326
( wind howling )

455
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,286
The heart?

456
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,286
Where is the crystal?

457
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,997
Here. It rolled over to me

458
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,997
when you dropped it.

459
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,791
Don't move!

460
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,879
You can move.

461
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,879
Just not toward me.

462
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,677
How could I have been

463
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:27,677
so foolish?

464
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,345
I was just so eager

465
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:29,345
to get it.

466
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,890
Then when I saw

467
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,890
what was going on outside, I...

468
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,558
SPIKE:

469
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,558
You have to get out of there.

470
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,810
You have to brings the Crystal

471
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,810
Heart to Princess Cadence.

472
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,230
If you don't,

473
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,230
you fail Celestia's test.

474
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,733
King Sombra is already

475
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,733
attacking the empire.

476
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,401
He could reach

477
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:43,401
the Crystal Ponies

478
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,778
at any moment.

479
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:48,281
Reach Princess Cadence,

480
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:48,281
my brother, my friends.

481
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:52,452
There may not be enough time

482
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:52,452
for me to find a way to escape.

483
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,458
You have to be the one

484
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,293
to bring the Crystal Heart

485
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,293
to the faire.

486
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:01,544
Me? But, Twilight--

487
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,754
Go.

488
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,631
But--

489
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:04,631
Go!

490
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,472
( ponies whimpering

491
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,472
and screaming )

492
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,890
APPLEJACK:

493
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,890
Now don't y'all worry

494
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,683
your pretty,

495
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,683
little Crystal heads.

496
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,770
The real Crystal Heart

497
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,770
will be here any second.

498
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,314
I don't know

499
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,314
if they believe you.

500
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,650
I don't know

501
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,650
if I believe me.

502
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,778
( gasps )

503
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,618
He's back!

504
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:33,618
I can't take it!

505
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:34,828
Ah!

506
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,370
( growls )

507
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,914
Ah! King Sombra.

508
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,460
My crystal slaves.

509
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,086
( whimpering )

510
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,465
( grunts )

511
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,675
Hey! Up here!

512
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,884
Spike?

513
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,636
I got the Crystal Heart!

514
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,890
That is mine!

515
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,187
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

516
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:07,861
Spikey-wikey!

517
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,712
Huh?

518
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,132
CRYSTAL PONY:

519
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,132
Who is that?

520
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,844
Behold!

521
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:32,844
The Crystal Princess!

522
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,430
The Crystal Heart

523
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,430
has returned.

524
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,432
Use the light

525
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,432
and love within you

526
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,894
to insure that King Sombra

527
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,894
does not.

528
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,907
What?

529
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:56,367
No! No!

530
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,702
Stop!

531
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,046
(<i> majestic theme playing</i> )

532
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,006
Oh!

533
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,518
( screams )

537
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,550
Good job, Spike.

538
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,976
RARITY:

539
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,976
I do so wish it was permanent.

540
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,812
Did you see how my mane

541
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,812
just absolutely sparkled?

542
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,815
But good things are better

543
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:08,815
when they're a rarity.

544
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,524
Oh!

SHINING ARMOR:

546
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:11,859
Everything's going to be okay.

547
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:15,029
You've got to stop

548
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:15,029
saving my rump like this.

549
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,615
It's starting

550
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,615
to get embarrassing.

551
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,119
Wasn't me who saved you

552
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,119
in the end, it was Spike.

553
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,622
It's just a test.

554
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:24,622
Maybe she'll let you retake it.

555
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,249
I don't think she's going

556
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,249
to give me a new test.

557
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,506
Keep it together, buddy.

558
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:35,800
Gotta stay strong...for Twilight

559
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,593
It's beautiful.

560
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,596
I wish it had been me

561
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,596
who ultimately made it so.

562
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,264
But it wasn't.

563
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:44,475
Twilight, as I understand it,

564
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,727
Spike brought Princess Cadence

565
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,727
the Crystal Heart

566
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,688
because you weren't sure

567
00:19:46,853 --> 00:19:48,688
how quickly

568
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,606
you could find a way

569
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,606
to escape the tower.

570
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,776
You weren't willing to risk

571
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,776
the future of the citizens

572
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,153
of the Crystal Empire

573
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,989
in an effort

574
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,989
to guarantee your own.

575
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,282
Far better that I have

576
00:19:58,114 --> 00:20:00,282
a student who understands

577
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,283
the meaning

578
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:02,702
of self-sacrifice,

579
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,538
than one who only looks out

580
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:05,538
for her own best interests.

581
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,665
Does this mean...?

582
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,879
She's totally

583
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,879
going to lose it.

584
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,296
Keep it together, buddy.

585
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,966
I gotta stay strong

586
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,966
for Twilight.

587
