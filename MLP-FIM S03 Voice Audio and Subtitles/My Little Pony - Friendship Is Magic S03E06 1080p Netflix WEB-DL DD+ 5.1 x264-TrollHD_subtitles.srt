She really said that?

I mean, it's like

40
00:01:24,543 --> 00:01:26,169
she practically told me

41
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,880
she wanted to take me

42
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:27,880
under her wing,

00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:32,175
teach me everything she knows,

44
00:01:28,005 --> 00:01:32,175

about all that.

I know, I know.

50

But all that stuff

51
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,435
I said could happen, right?

52
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,520
Sure.

53
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,520
Absolutely.

54
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,314
I just need to find a way

55
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,314
to spend some time with her.

56
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,234
You know, so she can see

57
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,234
more of my awesomeness.

58
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,487
Well, Applejack and I are

59
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,487
supposed to be camping

60
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,489
up at Winsome Falls

61
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,489
this weekend.

62
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,951
Maybe I could get my big sis

63
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:56,951
to invite Rainbow Dash,

64
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,410
and then

65
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:58,410
you could come too.

66
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,327
Really?!

67
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,747
Sure.

68
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:01,747
I wanna go.

69
00:02:01,872 --> 00:02:03,082
Well, duh.

70
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,332
Of course you can go.

71
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,794
And I'll get Rarity

72
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,794
to come too.

73
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:08,837
Rarity loves camping!

74
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,798
I despise camping!

75
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:14,342
All of that--

76
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:14,342
Ugh! --nature.

77
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,220
Applejack's going

78
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:17,220
with her little sister.

79
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:19,306
But, you know,

80
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,934
if you don't want

81
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,934
to spend time with me...

82
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,604
Oh, all right.

83
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,731
Oh! Of course I will need

84
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:27,731
to find an outfit

85
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,859
more appropriate

86
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:30,859
for roughing it. Ooh.

87
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,612
See? Told you

88
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,612
she'd want to go.

89
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,452
You pack the bug spray?

90
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,452
Yep.

91
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:43,246

Gee, Rarity,

97
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,716
did you remember to pack?

98
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,718
Oh, well, see who gets

your eyelash curler.

about Rainbow Dash?

108
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,354

up at our first campsite.

asked that, the answer was no.

This time,

00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,458
it's actually yes.

There's Rainbow Dash

you guys so long?

Well, some of us

didn't pack as light

as the others,

137
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:05,620

when Rarity had wings,

176
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,106
and then they got ruined,

177
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:14,106
and then you saved her

00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,941
from plummeting

179
00:05:14,231 --> 00:05:15,941
to her doom?

And then

194
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,758
the Olden Pony asked,

00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,225

203
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,187
Something

204
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,187
in my throat.

205
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:55,063
I wasn't scared at all.

206
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:56,857
Ha-ha. Good story!

207
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,942
Knew you

208
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,942
wouldn't be scared.

209
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,235
Way you jumped

210
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,235
that cart the other day.

211
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,904
You're like me,

212
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,904

213
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,781
Yeah, fearless.

226

231
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,096
But not me. Heh.

232
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,681

234
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,059

to get to spend time

393
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,104
( screaming )

394
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,362
Here you go!

395
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,362
That's it?

396
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,322
It's all I could find,

397
00:12:17,487 --> 00:12:19,322
because, you know,

398
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,242
there aren't

399
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,242
that many trees around here.

400
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,204
It's all we need.

401
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,204
Why don't you sit

402
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,664
with Rainbow Dash

403
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,664
for a while?

404
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,462
Now, where was I?

405
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:38,299
Oh, yeah,

406
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:38,299
the scary part.

407
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,676
( cackles )

408
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,346
Hey, I have an idea.

409
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,932
How about

410
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,932
I tell tonight's story?

411
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,225
All right,

412
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,060
just make sure

413
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:49,060
it's a horrible one.

414
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,230
SCOOTALOO:

415
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,230
There once was

416
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,230
a really, really nice pony

417
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,857
who lived in

418
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,857
a bright and sunny land,

419
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,859
where there were

420
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,859
rainbows every day

421
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,613
and lots and lots

422
00:12:56,984 --> 00:12:59,613
of happy friends, and--

423
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,989
No offense, but it's not

424
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,989
a real campfire story

425
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,367
unless

426
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,367
somepony's shaking.

427
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,035
I've been told

428
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,496
that these very woods

429
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,496
are haunted...

430
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:12,751
...by the Headless Horse!

431
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,045
It gallops only at night.

432
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,131
If it doesn't have a head,

433
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,131
then how in tarnation

434
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,882
does this pony

435
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,882
know where it's goin'?

436
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,010
It's headless,

437
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:23,010
not brainless.

438
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,889
Looking for

439
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:26,889
little lost ponies...

440
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,100
So where's its brain?

441
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,143
Ugh.

442
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,271
Fear was dripping

443
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:33,271
from the air...

444
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:37,900
...and they were never

445
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:37,900
heard from ever again!

446
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,611
Ah! Never?

447
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,613
Never.

448
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:42,989
( fire cracks )

449
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,907
( both scream )

450
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,451
( both chuckle )

451
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,453
( teeth chattering )

452
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,621
Don't worry,

453
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,372
you'll be safe

454
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,372
with me tonight.

455
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,125
It's not time

456
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,125
for bed yet, is it?

457
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,585
Afraid so, Scootaloo.

458
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:56,919
Uh, but

459
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,213
we haven't even sung

460
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,213
any campfire songs yet.

461
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,508
You don't have

462
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,508
to ask me twice!

Good night, sweetie.

Good night, y'all.

Good night, y'all.

485
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,082
Sleep tight.

486
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,293
How about

487
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,293
just one more song?

488
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,961
Anyone?

489
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,380
How about

490
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,380
a dance contest?

491
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,256
I know you love

492
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:42,256
to cut a rug,

493
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,676
so how about we mess up

494
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,676
a cave floor?

495
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:46,344
I have a brilliant idea!

496
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,346
Hide and seek,

497
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,346
who's with me?

( yawns )

499
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,266
Maybe tomorrow.

500
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,477
Aww.

501
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,978
Seems like you

502
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,978
don't really want

503
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:56,979
to go

504
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:56,979
to sleep tonight.

505
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,481
Is there

506
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,481
some reason why?

507
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,607
( scoffs )

508
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,359
Of course not.

509
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,654
I just love camping and hanging

510
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:04,654
out with Rainbow Dash so much

511
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,991
that I don't want to waste

512
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:08,991
a single minute with sleep.

513
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:11,327
( yawns then chuckles )

514
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,995
Silly sleep.

515
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,997
That's cool

516
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,997
and all, Scoot,

517
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,457
but this pony needs

518
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:16,457
her shut-eye,

519
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,501
and she needs it now!

520
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,088
Uh, this is so unfair.

521
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:25,091
( sighs then yawns )

522
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:28,344

If the Headless Horse

catches me,

528
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,206
I'm never gonna

529

be heard from again,

530
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,042
and I want

00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,042
to be heard from!

00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,545
Whoa! Whoa!

Princess Luna.

I thought you were

the Headless Horse.

546
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,665
You were mistaken,

547
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:38,665
but I hope not disappointed.

548
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,751
You are so, so much better

549
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,751
than the Headless Horse.

550
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,085
But what are

551
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,085
you doing here?

552
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,879
Shouldn't you be

553
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,879
in Canterlot?

554
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,756
I am the princess

00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,843
thus it is my duty

557
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,843
to come into your dreams.

558
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:51,093
Oh, yeah.

559
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,721
Wait, this is

560
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,721
just a dream?

561
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,557
But it feels so real.

562
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,686
I assure you

563
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:59,686
that you are asleep.

564
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,228
But when you wake,

565
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,774
the thing that frightens

566
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:04,774
you most will still exist.

567
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:07,777

Mm, is the Headless Horse

you the most?

00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:13,992
Mm-mm.

00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,410
I'm afraid Rainbow Dash

573
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,410
will find out

574
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,413
I'm not as tough

575
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:19,413

in their own way.

00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,546
But they must be faced,

581
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,131
or the nightmares

582
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,131
will continue.

But the Headless Horse isn't!

Rainbow Dash said

590
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,864
it lives here,

591
00:17:52,989 --> 00:17:55,825
in these very woods!

593
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,415
It's the wicked whinny

of the Headless Horse!

( Scootaloo panting )

597
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,675
So it's a horse

598
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:12,675
without a head,

599
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,011
which means

600
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,011
it doesn't have a mouth,

601
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,512
and if it doesn't

602
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,512
have a mouth,

603
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,807
then it's not

604
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,807
a horse-eat-pony kind of horse.

605
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,350
But still,

606
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,771
it's a horse

607
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,771
without a head!

Is anyone out there?

00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,788
Anyone except

612
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:41,788

I got you!

Rainbow Dash, is that you?

619
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,768
Thank you! Thank you!

620
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,689
What were you doing out here

621
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:08,689
in the middle of the night?

622
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,238
It is time for you

I'm so, so sorry,

627
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,126
Rainbow Dash.

628
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,752
I just wanted you

629
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,752
to hang out with me

630
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,254
and see how cool I was so

631
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,254
you'd take me under your wing,

632
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,631
teach me everything you know,

633
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,800
and become, like,

634
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,800
my big sister.

635
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,844
But then you started telling

636
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,844
those spooky stories,

637
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,637
and I got scared.

638
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,097
I thought I heard

639
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:41,097
the Headless Horse

640
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,599
so I ran out here

641
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,599
by myself and--

642
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,269
Well, I guess

643
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,269
you know the rest.

644
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,147
( sniffling )

645
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,565
Hey, I'm gonna

646
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,565
tell you something,

647
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,028
but if you ever tell anypony

648
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,028
else, I'm gonna deny it.

649
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,947

650
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,947
those stories,

651
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,282
I was scared too.

652
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:02,160
You were?

653
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,786
Sure.

654
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,913
I mean, I got over it,

655
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,913
because I realized pretty quick

656
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,248
that if there was such

657
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,248
a thing as a Headless Horse,

658
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,169
I could

659
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:11,169
totally take it on.

660
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,337

Mm-hm.

664
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,092
Yeah, I might be up

665
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,092
for something like that.

666
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,218
Really?

667
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,761
As long as

668
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,761
you don't go falling

669
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,222
