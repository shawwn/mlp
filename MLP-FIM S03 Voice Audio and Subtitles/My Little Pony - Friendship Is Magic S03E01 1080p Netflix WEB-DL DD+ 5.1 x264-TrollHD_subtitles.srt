But not before he was able

to put a curse upon the empire,

117
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,118
a curse that caused it

118
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:03,118
to vanish into thin air.

119
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:08,999
If the empire is filled

120

with hope and love,

121
00:04:09,124 --> 00:04:13,336
those things are reflected

for what, exactly?

208
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,288
Twilight.

209
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,581
Did you pass?

210
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,666
Are we gonna celebrate

211
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,666
your awesomeness

212
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,668
with Princess Celestia?

213
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,796
TWILIGHT:

214
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,796
Not quite.

215
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,549
We're going

216
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:46,549
to the Crystal Empire.

217
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,759
Huh?

218
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:47,759
Huh?

219
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,261
Crystal what?

220
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,431
( train whistle blows )

221
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,362
Ha, and you all made fun of me

222
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,362
for packing so many scarves.

223
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,864
Ugh! I didn't say a word.

224
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,617
Ah!

225
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,369
Hey. Come here.

226
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,912
SHINING ARMOR:

227
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,912
Twilight!

228
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,372
Shining Armor?

229
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,751
Twily, you made it!

230
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:25,297
We'd better get moving.

231
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,007
There are things out here

232
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,134
we really don't want

233
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:29,134
to run into after dark.

234
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:30,593
What kind of things?

235
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,595
Let's just say the empire

236
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,639
isn't the only thing

237
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,639
that's returned.

238
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,687
Something keeps trying

239
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,687
to get in.

240
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,232
We think it's the unicorn king

241
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:44,232
who originally cursed the place.

242
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,485
But Princess Celestia

243
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:46,485
said I was being sent here

244
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,487
to find a way

245
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,487
to protect the empire.

246
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:50,489
If King Sombra can't get in,

247
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,615
then it must already

248
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,615
be protected.

249
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,202
( creature howling distantly )

250
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,330
Ah! That-- That's one

251
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,330
of the things, isn't it?

252
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,375
We have to get

253
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,375
to the Crystal Empire now!

254
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,462
( snarling )

255
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,513
Go! Go!

256
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,516
SHINING ARMOR:

257
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,516
Almost there.

258
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,408
( sighs )

259
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:36,243
Everypony okay?

260
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:38,495
( ponies pant )

261
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,707
Oh, no.

262
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,667
Shining Armor, your horn.

263
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,719
Sparklerific!

264
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,309
RARITY:

265
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,309
It's gorgeous.

266
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,644
Absolutely gorgeous.

267
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,647
( stammers )

268
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,608
There are no words!

269
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,360
Focus, Rarity.

270
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,488
We're here to help Twilight,

271
00:10:10,485 --> 00:10:13,488
not admire the scenery.

272
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,574
RAINBOW DASH:

273
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,574
Eh, I don't see

274
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,574
what the big deal is.

275
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,159
Just looks like another

276
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,159
old castle to me.

277
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,494
( scoffs and spits )

278
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,288
Another old--

279
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,290
Have you lost your mind?

280
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,290
Look at the magni--

281
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:25,292
( laughs )

282
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,876
Very funny.

283
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,718
Cadence!

284
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:39,598
Oh.

285
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,142
BOTH:

286
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,142
Sunshine, sunshine.

287
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,142
Ladybug's awake.

288
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,186
Clap your hooves

289
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:45,186
and do a little shake.

290
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,521
( both laugh )

291
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,109
One of these days

292
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,109
we need to get together

293
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:55,029
when the fate of Equestria

294
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:55,029
isn't hanging in the balance.

295
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,739
Are you okay?

296
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,576
Cadence has been able to use her

297
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,576
magic to spread love and light.

298
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,078
That seems to be

299
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,078
what is protecting it.

300
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,747
But she hasn't slept.

301
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,747
Barely eats.

302
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,749
I want to help her,

303
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,749
but my protection spell

304
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,751
has been countered

305
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,751
by King Sombra.

306
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,505
It's all right, Shining Armor.

307
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,505
I'm fine.

308
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,591
She's not fine. She can't

309
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,591
go on like this forever.

310
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,759
And if her magic were

311
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,759
to fade...

312
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,387
Well, you saw what's out there

313
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,387
waiting for that to happen.

314
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:21,097
That's why we're here.

315
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,599
APPLEJACK:

316
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:22,599
Why we're all here.

317
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,766
ALL:

318
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:23,766
Mm-hmm.

319
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,768
With Cadence putting

320
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,768
all her strength

321
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,895
into keeping her spell going

322
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,895
and me trying to keep an eye

323
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,148
on signs of trouble

324
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,148
in the Arctic,

325
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,774
we haven't been able

326
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,774
to gather much information

327
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,610
from the Crystal Ponies.

328
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:34,777
Crystal Ponies?

329
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,196
( laughs )

330
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:37,614
There are Crystal Ponies?

331
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,161
Um, ahem,

332
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:43,161
please continue.

333
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,787
But we have to believe

334
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:44,787
one of them knows

335
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,581
how we can protect the empire

336
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,792
without having

337
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,792
to use Cadence's magic.

338
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,586
A research paper.

339
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,795
Huh?

340
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,797
That must be part

341
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,797
of my test.

342
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,799
To gather information

343
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,799
from the Crystal Ponies

344
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,426
and deliver it to you.

345
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:02,389
This is gonna be great.

346
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:02,389
I love research papers.

347
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,474
Yeah. Who doesn't?

348
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,142
Oh, oh, oh,

349
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,142
let me guess.

350
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,896
Is it Spike? No, no, no.

351
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,896
Fluttershy? Rarity?

352
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,523
Don't worry, big brother.

353
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,317
I am really good

354
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,317
at this sort of thing.

355
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,405
Are you sure?

356
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:18,405
Absolutely sure?

357
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,157
I'm sorry.

358
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,157
I wish I could help you.

359
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,410
But I can't seem

360
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,410
to remember anything

361
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,828
before King Sombra came

362
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,828
to power.

363
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,830
And I don't want

364
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,830
to remember anything

365
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,832
about the time he ruled

366
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,832
over us.

367
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:31,251
( shuddering )

368
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,253
King Sombra's spell

369
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,253
must be why

370
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,838
their coats aren't...

371
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,838
crystally.

372
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,675
Have we really been gone

373
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,675
a thousand years?

374
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:39,842
Yes.

375
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,845
It feels like it was

376
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,845
just yesterday.

377
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,266
If you think of anything,

378
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,266
even the smallest thing...

379
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:48,518
Of course.

380
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,562
Well, that was

381
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:50,562
a total bust.

382
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,980
Maybe the others

383
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:52,980
are having better luck.

384
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:54,899
A way to protect the empire.

385
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,277
You know anything

386
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,277
about it or what?

387
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,655
I wish I could help you.

388
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,655
Really.

389
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,408
Come on.

390
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,408
You gotta know something.

391
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,411
But I don't have

392
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,411
any information.

393
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,707
Oh, um, excuse me.

394
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,001
Oh, hello.

395
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:14,001
Um, I was just wondering...

396
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,260
Oh, oh, that's okay.

397
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,260
Um, you all look really busy.

398
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:23,762
( laughs nervously )

399
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,099
Time to gather some intel.

400
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,895
It just feels like something

401
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,895
is missing.

402
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,606
I know.

403
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,901
It looks the same,

404
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:38,901
but it doesn't feel the same.

405
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,903
Because it isn't.

406
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,572
A spy!

407
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,115
( screams )

408
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,787
A spy?

409
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:48,787
How did they know?

410
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,748
Ah, must have noticed

411
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,748
my night-vision goggles.

412
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,083
Ooh, night visiony.

413
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,380
( hums )

414
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,466
And when you flip your mane,

415
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,927
it simply must create

416
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,927
a rainbow of color.

417
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,473
Wouldn't I look

418
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:08,473
just magnificent?

419
00:14:08,598 --> 00:14:09,974
So sparkly.

420
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,934
( giggles )

421
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,608
I got nothing so far.

422
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,943
Oh, me neither.

423
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,032
My cover has been blown.

424
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,493
I repeat, my cover

425
00:14:26,157 --> 00:14:28,493
has been blown.

426
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,371
Okay.

427
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,371
Sorry, Twilight.

428
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,498
These Crystal Ponies seem

429
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,498
to have some kind

430
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,542
of collective amnesia

431
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,542
or something.

432
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,835
Only thing I was able

433
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:36,835
to get out of them

434
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,545
was something

435
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,545
about a library.

436
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,046
( gasps )

437
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,590
A library?

438
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:42,590
Well, why didn't you say so?

439
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:45,009
Uh, thought I just did.

440
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,478
I just--

441
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,478
I don't even know what to--

442
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,480
There are no words.

443
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,773
( clears throat )

444
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,525
May I help you?

445
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,527
Yes. We're looking

446
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,527
for a book.

447
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,571
We have plenty of those.

448
00:15:04,696 --> 00:15:08,032
You do. You really do.

449
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,284
We're looking

450
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,284
for a history book,

451
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,328
something that might tell us

452
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:12,328
how the empire

453
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,831
might have protected itself

454
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,831
from danger back in the day.

455
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,624
Yes, of course.

456
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,459
History. History.

457
00:15:18,585 --> 00:15:20,002
Ah, yes.

458
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,009
Which is where, exactly?

459
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,888
I...I can't seem

460
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,888
to remember.

461
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,682
I'm not sure

462
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:32,682
I actually work here.

463
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,559
Ugh!

464
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,559
We'll just take a look around.

465
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,019
I'm sure we can find it

466
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,019
on our own.

467
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,064
Let me know

468
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:40,064
if you find anything.

469
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,483
I like her.

470
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,924
Uh, anyone else starting

471
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:05,924
to think this is a lost cause?

472
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,635
No. No. No. No.

473
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,053
No.

474
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,555
Yes!

475
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,769
<i>History</i>

476
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,769
<i>of the Crystal Empire.</i>

477
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,939
I just hope

478
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:20,939
it has the answers we need.

479
00:16:26,235 --> 00:16:27,779
A Crystal Faire.

480
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,198
According to this book, it was

481
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:31,198
established by their first queen

482
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,701
and became

483
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,701
their most important tradition.

484
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,870
The faire was held

485
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:35,870
every year to...

486
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,665
"Renew the spirit of love

487
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,665
and unity in the empire

488
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,708
so they could protect it

489
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:40,708
from harm."

490
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,794
My friends and I

491
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:42,794
can put it together.

492
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,879
Everything we need to know is

493
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,879
in the book.

494
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,840
That sounds

495
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,840
pretty promising.

496
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,217
We'll get started

497
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,217
right away.

498
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,721
Come on, Spike, we've got

499
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:53,721
a Crystal Faire to put together.

500
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:55,598

I don't know how I could have

541
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:31,694
done this without you.

542
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,405
One last check to make sure

543
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,405
everything is in place

544
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,490
and then the festivities

545
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,490
can begin.

546
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,534
What's this thing for?

547
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,578
The last page of the book

548
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,914
mentioned a crystal heart

549
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,914
as the faire's centerpiece,

550
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,917
so I used my magic to cut one

551
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,917
out of a crystal block.

552
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,752
Nice work, Twi.

553
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,797
Think we're ready to get

554
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,797
this faire up and running.

555
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,802
( inhaling deeply )

556
00:18:55,927 --> 00:19:00,389
( playing off-key notes )

557
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,850
Hear ye, hear--

558
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,519
Flugelhorn!

559
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:09,482
( laughs nervously )

560
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:10,691
My bad.

561
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,944
( clears throat )

562
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:14,946
Hear ye, hear ye!

563
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,615
Princess Cadence

564
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,615
and Prince Shining Armor

565
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,744
do cordially invite you

566
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,744
to attend the Crystal Faire.

567
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,455
( Crystal Ponies murmuring )

568
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,046
Come on in, y'all.

569
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,714
Got food and drinks

570
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,714
thataway.

571
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,466
Games and crafts

572
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,466
are thataway.

573
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,011
Crystal Heart's in the back

574
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,011
near the princess.

575
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,597
Did she say,

576
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:41,597
"crystal heart"?

577
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,975
( murmuring )

578
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,060
We totally nailed it, right?

579
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:50,523
Must be feeling a lot of love

580
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:50,523
and unity about now.

581
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,900
Gonna have some grub, huh?

582
00:19:50,648 --> 00:19:52,900
What are you thinking?

583
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:54,902
Crystal Empire Berry Pie?

584
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,363
Maybe some

585
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,363
Crystal Corn on the Cob?

586
00:19:57,488 --> 00:20:00,825
What is with these ponies?

587
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,660
Seeing all of this,

588
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,329
I feel like I'm starting

589
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:05,329
to remember,

590
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,748
remember things

591
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,748
from before the king.

592
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:10,334
Me too.

593
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,544
( gasps )

594
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,544
( gasps )

595
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,046
BOTH:

596
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,046
The Crystal Heart!

597
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,755
Do you think

598
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,755
they really have it?

599
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,090
Of course we have it.

600
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,800
Can't have a Crystal Faire

601
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,802
without the Crystal Heart,

602
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,802
right?

603
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:22,471
Of course you can't.

604
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,473
The whole purpose

605
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,473
of the Crystal Faire is

606
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,475
to lift the spirits

607
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,475
of the Crystal Ponies

608
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,644
so the light within them

609
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,644
can power the Crystal Heart

610
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,813
so that the empire

611
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,813
can be protected.

612
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,191
I do work at the library.

613
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,985
What's that

614
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,985
about powering the heart?

615
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,987
I just can't believe

616
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,987
you found it.

617
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,989
King Sombra said

618
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,989
he'd hidden it away

619
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,033
where we would never

620
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,033
see it again.

621
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,452
I only hope it will still be as

622
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:45,452
powerful after all these years.

623
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,121
Mmm, funnel cake.

624
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,123
( squeaks )

625
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,377
Why did you--?

626
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,215
I think we may have

627
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:57,215
a problem.

628
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,966
I didn't know

629
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:58,966
it was an actual relic.

630
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,593
The book didn't

631
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,593
mention anything

632
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,221
about the Crystal Ponies

633
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,221
powering the heart.

634
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,016
There was a page missing.

635
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:07,016
How did I not notice?

636
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,352
It's all right,

637
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,352
Twilight.

638
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:13,147
Twily.

639
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,649
