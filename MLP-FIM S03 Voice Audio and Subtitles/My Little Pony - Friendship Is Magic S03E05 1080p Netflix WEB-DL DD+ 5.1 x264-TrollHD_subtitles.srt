00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:01,281
Ah. Okay.

391
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,158
All right!

392
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,158
Let's do it!

393
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,413
I know just the design for

00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,413

the magic force field

400

and Trixie intends

401
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,051
to punish them.

402
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:26,180
But wouldn't it be faster

403
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:26,180
if we had some wheels?

404
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,807
The great and powerful Trixie

405
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,807
doesn't trust wheels.

406
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,727
Now pull faster.

407
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,437
I'm telling you, Snips,

408
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,482
she's getting weirder

409
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:35,482

Why is she so mean to us?

416
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:07,597
Yeah, I miss the days

417
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:07,597
when she was just a fraud.

Oh, dear.

420

Rarity's dangerous mission

422
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,780
Guess we better go back.

Oh. Okay, okay,

00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:28,535
you're right.

427
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,578
I need to be brave

428
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,578
and find Twilight.

She's in the Ever-Free Forest?

432

I want to be brave at home.

Locked in my closet.

00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:46,302
With my teddy bear.

437
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,018
I can't believe I didn't

438
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:54,018
recognize the Alicorn Amulet.

439
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,063
The more she uses it,

440
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,063
the more it will corrupt her.

441
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,232
But how am I supposed

442
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,232
to beat that amulet?

443
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,150
My magic's not good enough.

444
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,695
Twilight Sparkle,

00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,695
much work have you done.

446
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,240
You learned all of my lessons,

447
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,240
all but one.

448
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,660
If Trixie's tricks

449
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,660
have you in a fix,

450
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,205
you must nix your magic

451
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:14,205
and use the six.

452
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,500
Nix your magic,

453
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,500
use the six...

00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,502
Nix your magic,

455
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,502
use the six.

456
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,504
Use the six.

457
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,504
That's it!

458
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,465
Zecora, you're a genius.

459
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:28,428
Now, we'll need to get you back

(<i> mellow theme playing</i> )

462
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,481
This better not

463
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,481
be another false alarm,

464
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,234
or the great and powerful

465
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,234
Trixie will--

00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,737
You!

467
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,739
What's the matter,

Twilight Sparkle?

469
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,532
Not enjoying your exile?

470
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,451
I know about

471
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:51,451
the Alicorn Amulet.

472
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,702
I know you cheated.

Cheated?<i> Moi?</i>

474
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,540
Yeah, and I thought

475
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:57,540
you might want to see

476
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,626
what a real magical amulet

477
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,626
looks like.

478
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,377
Zecora gave it to me.

479
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:03,379
It's from beyond

the Ever-Free Forest

481
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,714
and it's way more powerful

482
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,800
than your measly

483
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:06,800

than the Alicorn Amulet.

486
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:16,183
And nopony's more powerful than

where your mouth is?

491
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,272
How about another duel?

00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,272
Why should I?

Wait.

Snips. Snails.

( both crying )

510
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,525
An oldie but a goodie.

511
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,528
Now let's see what

512
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,528
your little charm can do.

513
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,697
No problem.

514
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,490
Um, Applejack? Rarity?

515
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,325
Could you help me, please?

516
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,285
Huh?

517
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,285
Huh?

Ho-hum.

That's impossible!

584

<i>The magic of friendship.</i>

585
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,832
I also knew

586
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,832
that the only pony

587
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,876
who could get the amulet

588
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,876
off your neck was you.

589
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:14,213
But what about the pony

590
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:14,213
with the ten instruments?

591
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,716
That's not magic,

592
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,716
that was just Pinkie Pie.

600
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,330
Trixie?

601
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,332
It's the least I could do.

602
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,543
I treated you and

603
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:52,543
your friends so horribly

604
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,795
when I was wearing

605
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,795
that Alicorn Amulet.

606
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:57,464
I just couldn't control myself.

607
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,466
You can forgive me, can't you?

608
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:03,846
Hmm...

609
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,264
Sure.

610
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,183
Oh, good.

611
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,519
Don't you think the great
