1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:03,879
( peaceful music playing )

2
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:10,260
I love it when Princess Celestia

3
00:00:07,633 --> 00:00:10,260
comes to Ponyville!

4
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,012
I got my hooves shined just like

5
00:00:10,385 --> 00:00:13,012
Rarity for the occasion.

6
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:14,264
You like?

7
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:16,391
I certainly do.

8
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,393
I'm surprised

9
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,393
she's not here yet.

10
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,270
I wonder what's

11
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,270
taking so long.

12
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,063
And where are Applejack

13
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,063
and Fluttershy?

14
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,023
RARITY:

15
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,023
Fluttershy's detained

16
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,023
helping Applejack

17
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,025
with a mishap at

18
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:26,025
Sweet Apple Acres.

19
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,486
They'll be along.

20
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,905
I still don't get why the

21
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:29,905
Princess would be so late.

22
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,032
She's bringing

23
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,032
an important visitor.

24
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,408
That could be part

25
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:33,408
of it.

26
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,036
A visitor who's

27
00:00:33,534 --> 00:00:36,036
important and slow.

28
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,915
Maybe it's somepony so terribly

29
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:39,915
important she still had many

30
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,918
more terribly important things

31
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,918
to do before she got here.

32
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,545
( gasps )

33
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,797
Maybe the visitor has a deer

34
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,797
antler, a goat leg, a bat wing

35
00:00:46,922 --> 00:00:48,047
and a snake tail.

36
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,925
Yeah, right.

37
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,925
That's Discord.

38
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,177
Why in the wide wide

39
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,177
world of Equestria would

40
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,429
Princess Celestia bring along

41
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:54,429
someone like that?

42
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,265
M-maybe you should

43
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,265
ask her.

44
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,901
( scary music playing )

45
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:10,404

With all due respect,

67
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:51,528
Princess Celestia,

68
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,155
( shouting ):

69
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,155
how could you bring

70
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,155
Discord here?

71
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:55,407
( clears throat )

72
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,034
( meekly ):

73
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,034
Your majesty.

74
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,286
I'm fully aware that the

75
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,286
last time Discord was here,

76
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,663
he created serious havoc.

77
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,042
If by "serious havoc" you

78
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,042
mean turning Ponyville

79
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,168
into the chaos capital

80
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,168
of the world.

81
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,671
And tricking us all into being

82
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,671
the opposite of our true selves.

83
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,424
And making yummy delicious

84
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,424
chocolate milk rain all over

85
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,426
the place without a single

86
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,426
dollop of whipped cream to go

87
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,928
with it anywhere in sight.

88
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,055
Not a single dollop!

89
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:22,183
Yes, I understand, but I have

90
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:22,183
use for Discord's magic

91
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,562
if it can be reformed to serve

92
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:25,562
good instead of evil.

93
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,189
This is why I've

94
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,189
brought Discord here.

95
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,317
Because I believe that

96
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,317
you are the ponies

97
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,444
who can help him do just that.

98
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,571
This will never work!

99
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,571
This is a disaster!

100
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,198
How will we ever control him?

101
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,198
We're doomed!

102
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,077
Need I remind you that you are

103
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:40,077
the ponies who turned him back

104
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,329
into stone like this

105
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,329
in the first place?

106
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,332
I suppose we can just use the

107
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,332
Elements of Harmony

108
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,167
against him again

109
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:48,167
if he gets out of hand.

110
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,420
We probably need

111
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,420
a volunteer to run away

112
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,672
from here right away

113
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,672
to get them.

114
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,048
I'll do it!

115
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:54,549
No need, Spike.

116
00:02:54,675 --> 00:02:56,175
I have them right here.

117
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,928
And I've cast

118
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,928
a spell so Discord can't

119
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:00,430
take them and hide them again.

120
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,433
Now where

121
00:03:01,682 --> 00:03:03,433
is Fluttershy?

122
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,687
I believe she may know best how

123
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,687
to begin reforming Discord.

124
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,439
Fluttershy?

125
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,439
Really?

126
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:12,317
( chittering )

127
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,112
What's he goin'

128
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,112
on about now?

129
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:16,738
Good news.

130
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,824
Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth has

131
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,824
agreed to take his dam apart

132
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:19,825
and move it.

133
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,827
Well, it's

134
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:21,827
about time.

135
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,079
APPLEJACK:

136
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,079
My apple trees are

137
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:24,079
so waterlogged

138
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,580
I can practically

139
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:25,580
hear 'em gargle.

140
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,582
( indignant beaver sounds )

141
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,584
But he says first you'll

142
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,584
have to apologize

143
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,962
for calling him

144
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,962
"a nuisance."

145
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,340
Apologize? He's lucky I didn't

146
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:35,340
call him a varmint!

147
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,341
( outraged beaver sounds )

148
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:37,592
( gasps )

149
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,261
Mr. Beaverton Beaverteeth!

150
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:40,261
Such language!

151
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,307
Fine. Fine.

152
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,935
I apologize.

153
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:48,812
( growling )

154
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,693
( wood crashing )

155
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,072
Whew!

156
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:58,072
Thanks, Fluttershy.

157
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,074
Don't know what I woulda

158
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:00,074
done without ya.

159
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,200
Glad I could help.

160
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:02,951
Hey, slackers!

161
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,953
Double-time it on over

162
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:04,953
back to Ponyville, would ya?

163
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:07,455
We're all waiting on you.

164
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,958
( harp music plays )

165
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,212
PRINCESS CELESTIA:

166
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,212
I realize that this is a tall

167
00:04:10,084 --> 00:04:13,212
order, but I wouldn't ask

168
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,215
if I weren't confident you could

169
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,215
get him to use magic obediently

170
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,092
of his own

171
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,092
free will.

172
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,970
And you really think

173
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:21,970
I'll know best how to do that?

174
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,346
I do.

175
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,228
Now I must return to Canterlot

176
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,228
for Equestria's Royal Summit.

177
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,732
You may release Discord

178
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,732
when ready.

179
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,322
Okay, ponies. Guess it's time

180
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,322
to get started.

181
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,450
Let's just hope this

182
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,450
releasing spell works.

183
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,452
Or let's not.

184
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,955
TWILIGHT:

185
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,955
We'd best keep our elements

186
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,955
on at all times

187
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,206
till further notice.

188
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,582
PONIES:

189
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,582
Check!

190
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,211
( elements powering up )

191
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,338
( dramatic music playing )

192
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,733
( stone cracking )

193
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,615
( roaring )

194
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,242
( yawns )

195
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:27,995
Oof!

196
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,456
Well, it's about time somepony

197
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,456
got me out of that prison block.

198
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:33,333
What a relief!

199
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:37,212
( gasp )

200
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,214
What do you think

201
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,214
you're doing?

202
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,339
Oof!

203
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,467
Why, stretching of course!

204
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,719
When you're a creature of chaos,

205
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,598
stone bodysuits aren't your

206
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:48,598
typical go-to fashion choice.

207
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,100
( snaps )

208
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:52,351
( roaring )

209
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,353
( gasp )

210
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,355
Make that bunny

211
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,355
cute again. Now!

212
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,983
Oh, bah!

213
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,735
He's adorable

214
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,735
the way he is.

215
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,237
( roars )

216
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,614
You know what else is adorable?

217
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,742
You ponies truly believe

218
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,742
you can reform me.

219
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,120
And that you're putting your

220
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:10,120
faith in this one here

221
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,122
to make it happen.

222
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,500
Makes me wanna just pinch

223
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:15,500
your little horsie cheeks.

224
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,127
How'd you know

225
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,127
about that?

226
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,004
Being turned to stone

227
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:19,004
doesn't keep me

228
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,256
from hearing every word

229
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,256
Celestia says.

230
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,885
Although I'll admit it made

231
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,885
rolling my eyes a challenge.

232
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,972
Well, unless you want us to

233
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,972
turn you back to stone,

234
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,100
you'll zap those animals back to

235
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,100
the way they were, pronto.

236
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,477
Oh, you wouldn't dare

237
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:34,477
turn me back to stone

238
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,232
and risk disappointing

239
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:38,232
your precious Princess.

240
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,108
Try us, Dip-cord!

241
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,610
You think you can treat poor

242
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,610
defenseless animals like that

243
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,487
and get away with it?

244
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:46,240
You go, Fluttershy!

245
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,243
You best watch your step,

246
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:49,243
buster, or I'll give you

247
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:51,119
the stare!

248
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,122
( mocking fear ):

249
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,122
The stare? Oh no,

250
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:54,122
please not that.

251
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,750
Anything but your

252
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:56,750
disapproving eyeballs!

253
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,502
( Discord laughing )

254
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,382
Oh no! No, no, stop!

255
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,133
No, no!

256
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,261
I can't!

257
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,013
Stop, I can't take

258
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,013
it anymore!

259
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:14,642
I'll do whatever

260
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:14,642
you say because...

261
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,314
( laughing ):

262
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,314
You're hilarious!

263
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,234
If it turns out we need to use

264
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,234
our elements against you,

265
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,485
I'm sure we can convince

266
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:24,485
Princess Celestia

267
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,363
it was for

268
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,363
a good reason.

269
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,614
Hm.

270
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,490
I suppose

271
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:29,490
that's correct.

272
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,243
( roaring )

273
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:34,495
( roaring )

274
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,878
( nasty snarling )

275
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,381
Oopsie.

276
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:49,010
Well, it looks like I know where

277
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:49,010
I'll be crashing while I'm being

278
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:51,263
"reformed."

279
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,390
With you, Fluttershy!

280
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,516
( laughs )

281
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,270
Oh dear.

282
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:02,774
( peaceful music playing )

283
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,901
He may be horrible,

284
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:04,901
but that doesn't mean we have

285
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,153
to act the same way.

286
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,030
We should at least try

287
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:09,030
to be hospitable.

288
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,158
You don't mind giving up your

289
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,158
favorite spot on the couch,

290
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:12,909
do you, Angel Bunny?

291
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,745
( angry bunny noises )

292
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,998
FLUTTERSHY:

293
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,998
Oh! I'm sorry

294
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,998
about Angel.

295
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:19,624
Are you all right?

296
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,252
Oh, yes. Thank you, Fluttershy,

297
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:22,252
for your concern.

298
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,505
If only your pony friends

299
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:25,505
could be as considerate.

300
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,007
Don't listen

301
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,007
to him, Fluttershy!

302
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,883
He's just trying to drive

303
00:08:27,132 --> 00:08:28,883
a wedge between us

304
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,010
like he

305
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,010
always does.

306
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,763
Now why in the world

307
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:33,763
would I ever try

308
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,265
to do a thing like that?

309
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,267
So we can't unite

310
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,267
and use

311
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,020
the Elements of Harmony

312
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:40,020
against you, that's why.

313
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:42,272
I never thought of that.

314
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,898
RAINBOW DASH:

315
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,898
You big liar!

316
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,775
DISCORD:

317
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,775
Now look who's a liar.

318
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,404
Anyone can plainly see

319
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,404
I'm not big at all.

320
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,036
Oops.

321
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:59,039
There. All better.

322
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:03,168
I can't watch.

323
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:05,045
We'll be outside.

324
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,548
You sure you're okay

325
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,548
with this?

326
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,509
I know it's not going

327
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,509
to be easy,

328
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,886
But Princess Celestia is

329
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,886
counting on me.

330
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,514
And I think I actually

331
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,514
know what to do.

332
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,764
You do?

333
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,892
I think the key is

334
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,892
to befriend him.

335
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,644
Being kind to him and letting

336
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,644
him be my houseguest

337
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,646
is probably the

338
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,646
best way to do that.

339
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,190
And you really think

340
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,190
that will work?

341
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,774
I think it's

342
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,774
worth a try.

343
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,776
Okay. But if you

344
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,776
need us,

345
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,653
all you need to do

346
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,653
is whisper "help"

347
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,906
and we'll be back here

348
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,906
with our Elements.

349
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,535
So watch that goat-legged

350
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:36,535
step of yours, pal.

351
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,036
Wha-- What?

352
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,664
Look at me, I'm practically

353
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:41,664
reformed already.

354
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,794
She's really all right

355
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:46,794
with him staying there?

356
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,547
That's what she said.

357
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,673
Personally, I think we should

358
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,673
come up with a back-up plan

359
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,552
in case this whole befriending

360
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:53,552
business doesn't work out.

361
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,053
Rainbow Dash is right.

362
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,804
This is Discord we're

363
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,804
talking about, girls.

364
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,182
It wouldn't be a bad idea

365
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,182
to have another trick

366
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,184
up our sleeves.

367
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,811
And I think I know

368
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,811
just the trick.

369
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,813
Discord?

370
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,274
Oh, there you are.

371
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,150
Listen, Discord, I just want

372
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:09,150
to make sure you know

373
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,153
that if there's anything

374
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,153
I can do to--

375
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,530
Uh, um--

376
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,783
Are you eating paper?

377
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:18,034
Am I?

378
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,037
Huh. How odd of me.

379
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,291
Well, um, I'm just heading out,

380
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,668
so you just make yourself

381
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,668
at home while I'm gone.

382
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,047
DISCORD:

383
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,047
Bye-bye! Have a nice time!

384
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,925
Everything is fine here.

385
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,925
Bye-bye!

386
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,677
Bye-bye!

387
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,556
DISCORD:

388
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,556
You like carrots, Angel?

389
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,184
I'm playing your owner

390
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,184
for a fool. Ha, ha.

391
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:45,312
How do you like them carrots?

392
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:47,063
( screams )

393
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,196
That's weird. The spell I had

394
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,196
in mind isn't in here.

395
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,949
Spike, where are the other books

396
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,949
I asked you to pull?

397
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,159
Right here, Twilight.

398
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,785
I really want to have a

399
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:00,785
reforming spell

400
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,162
up and running pronto.

401
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,913
But what if he makes

402
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:03,913
the Elements of Harmony

403
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,665
disappear like he did

404
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,665
last time?

405
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,169
Princess Celestia cast a spell

406
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:09,169
protecting them, remember?

407
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,295
Uh-oh.

408
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,921
What's wrong?

409
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,673
Princess Celestia didn't cast a

410
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,673
spell protecting our books!

411
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,801
Everywhere I thought I'd find

412
00:11:14,799 --> 00:11:16,801
the reforming spell--

413
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,178
( gasps )

414
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,434
Are you sure this isn't

415
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,434
overdoing it?

416
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,811
You said to make myself at home

417
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,811
while you were gone,

418
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,439
but I wouldn't want

419
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,439
to overstep my bounds.

420
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,816
I did say that.

421
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,445
So, if this makes you more

422
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,445
comfortable, by all means,

423
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:37,071
please feel free.

424
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,199
Oh, well, it does.

425
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,199
Very much so.

426
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:43,203
You're so very kind,

427
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:43,203
my dear Fluttershy.

428
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,830
I always knew you were the

429
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,830
understanding one.

430
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,209
Not like those

431
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,209
nasty friends of yours.

432
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,085
My friends aren't nasty.

433
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,587
Well, of course

434
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,587
you'd say that.

435
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,923
It just goes to show how

436
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,923
understanding you truly are.

437
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,179
You know, I think Princess

438
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,179
Celestia is right when she

439
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,182
singled you out as the

440
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,182
one who could reform me.

441
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,933
You're off to such

442
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:05,933
a good start,

443
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,313
I'm seriously considering

444
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,313
actually being reformed.

445
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,814
TWILIGHT:

446
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:11,814
Fluttershy!

447
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,316
Fluttershy, can you hear me?

448
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,443
Goodness! I hear Twilight!

449
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,949
TWILIGHT:

450
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,949
Fluttershy, what's going on?

451
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:21,949
Are you okay?

452
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,827
We're fine.

453
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:24,827
Everything's going great.

454
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,080
Isn't it, Angel?

455
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,209
We've come to get you

456
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,209
away from Discord.

457
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,336
He's just terrible and,

458
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,336
from the looks of it,

459
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,088
completely out of control.

460
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:39,092
Oh but you're wrong.

461
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:39,092
We're making great progress.

462
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,968
TWILIGHT & SPIKE:

463
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:40,968
Seriously?

464
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,096
I'm earning his trust

465
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,096
by giving him a little space

466
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,847
to be himself.

467
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,476
Hate to break it to you, but he

468
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:48,476
used that "space to be himself"

469
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,811
to tear out all the reforming

470
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,811
spells from the library.

471
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,814
That does explain

472
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,814
the paper eating.

473
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,692
He ate them?

474
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,068
( groans )

475
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,945
But we aren't going

476
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,945
to need a spell.

477
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,448
He's already really

478
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,448
considering being reformed.

479
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,823
He said so.

480
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,701
And you believed him?

481
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,203
If I'm going to be his friend,

482
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:07,203
I have to start by giving him

483
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:08,455
the benefit of the doubt.

484
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,331
Tell you what,

485
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,459
bring all the ponies over for

486
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,459
a dinner party this evening,

487
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:16,963
and I'll bet his manners will

488
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:16,963
have really improved by then.

489
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,965
I'll even get him to put

490
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:18,965
the cottage back

491
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,217
on the ground first.

492
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,469
( sighs )

493
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,220
All right. Dinner it is.

494
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,974
Ugh.

495
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,974
I can't believe

496
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,351
we're having a dinner party

497
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,351
with Discord.

498
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,729
This evening is sure

499
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,729
to be a disaster.

500
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,398
Glad I didn't bother wearing

501
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:35,398
my fanciest outfit.

502
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,109
Fluttershy thinks this is

503
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,109
the way to reform Discord

504
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,487
and asked us to give it

505
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,487
a chance.

506
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,490
Oh, our pony guests.

507
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,827
We're so delighted that

508
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,827
you've come.

509
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,456
Please do come in.

510
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,210
FLUTTERSHY:

511
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,210
See what a beautiful job

512
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,210
he did helping?

513
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,088
Discord set the

514
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,088
entire table himself.

515
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,716
I'm so proud.

516
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,845
May I take your--

517
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,845
Ahem, hats, ladies?

518
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,723
Hang on to your

519
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,723
Elements, girls.

520
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,850
It's gonna be

521
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,850
a bumpy night.

522
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,355
FLUTTERSHY:

523
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,355
As you all know, Princess

524
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,355
Celestia hoped we'd help Discord

525
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,607
use his magic

526
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,607
for good instead of evil.

527
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,361
FLUTTERSHY:

528
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,361
Pinkie Pie, care

529
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,361
for some gravy?

530
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:22,862
You bet!

531
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,614
Allow me.

532
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,117
( panting, whimpers )

533
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,745
Ooh, what a cute

534
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,745
little gravy boat you are!

535
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,123
Yes you are,

536
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:34,123
yes you are!

537
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,752
That's one creepy little

538
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,752
gravy boat if you ask me.

539
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,464
Oh come on now, Dashie, you're

540
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,464
not even giving this a chance.

541
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,841
( panting )

542
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,342
Hey, that's hot!

543
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,094
Oops! Well,

544
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,094
I'm so sorry.

545
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,471
He did that

546
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,471
on purpose!

547
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,473
Oh, well I don't

548
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,473
know about that.

549
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,099
Mistakes happen.

550
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,103
Ooh, look, everypony.

551
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:56,103
Dancing candles!

552
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,483
I'm not falling

553
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,483
for that!

554
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:04,487
Discord's just trying to

555
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:04,487
distract us from--

556
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,364
Hey! Knock it off!

557
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,241
I suppose that's

558
00:15:06,489 --> 00:15:08,241
another "mistake?"

559
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,244
No, I think you just

560
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,244
made them mad.

561
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,995
There's something

562
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:12,995
fishy going on.

563
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:18,000
Discord?

564
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,127
Well, it's hardly my fault if

565
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,127
the soup tureen finds the term

566
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,381
"something fishy"

567
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,381
to be offensive.

568
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,383
Not the dress,

569
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,383
not the dress!

570
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,135
That tureen's only doin' what

571
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:28,135
you're makin' it do!

572
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,139
Now let's not jump

573
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:32,139
to any conclusions.

574
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,225
Fluttershy, can't you

575
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,225
see what he's doing?

576
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,227
He's playing innocent with you

577
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,227
so you'll never agree

578
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,230
to use the Elements

579
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,230
of Harmony against him.

580
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,734
Oh, well that's

581
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:42,734
a bit harsh, isn't it?

582
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,113
You see what I'm saying,

583
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,113
right, Fluttershy?

584
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,489
Fluttershy?

585
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,116
You know what I see?

586
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,243
I see that Discord's far

587
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,243
from perfect,

588
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,871
but I also see none

589
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,871
of you giving him a chance.

590
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,247
PONIES:

591
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:56,247
Come on!

592
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,624
RAINBOW DASH:

593
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,624
What's gotten into you?

594
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,376
Why do you keep cutting him

595
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,376
so much slack?

596
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,380
Because that's

597
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,380
what friends do.

598
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,882
( softly ):

599
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,882
We're friends?

600
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,383
Why, of course.

601
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,260
I can't remember my house

602
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,260
ever being this lively

603
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,763
before you came along.

604
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,264
Oh...

605
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,267
Well, I've never really had

606
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,267
a friend before.

607
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,771
Well, now you do.

608
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,153
Now is not a good time, Angel.

609
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:27,153
We're having a dinner party.

610
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,492
APPLEJACK:

611
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,492
Hold up. I think he's tryin'

612
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:32,492
to tell us somethin'.

613
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,244
ALL:

614
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:35,244
Apple! Applejack!

615
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,621
( groans )

616
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,501
Oh, oh, oh!

617
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,501
Sweet Apple Acres?

618
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,378
Flooding at

619
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,378
Sweet Apple Acres!

620
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,756
And we all know who's

621
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:46,756
behind that, now don't we.

622
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,383
Who, me?

623
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,135
RAINBOW DASH:

624
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,135
Oh, give it a rest.

625
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,763
What do you think of your

626
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,763
friend now, Fluttershy?

627
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:00,770
( suspensful music playing )

628
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,063
APPLEJACK:

629
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,063
I've never seen

630
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,063
the floodin' this bad!

631
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,900
They've built dams around here

632
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:05,900
before, but never like this.

633
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,527
What's goin' on?

634
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,778
( angry chatter )

635
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,405
( gasp )

636
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,405
Such language!

637
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,909
Oh, it's no use! They won't

638
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:14,909
listen to a word I say.

639
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,036
You see Discord's

640
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,036
behind all this, right?

641
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,788
Well, of course I do.

642
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,541
Do you all think I'm

643
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:21,541
a silly, gullible fool?

644
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:26,004
PONIES:

645
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:26,004
Oh, no, well, not exactly.

646
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,381
I've just been trying to gain

647
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,381
his friendship any way I can

648
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,508
so he'd come to trust

649
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:30,508
and listen to me.

650
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,885
DISCORD:

651
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:31,885
Hey there, Fluttershy!

652
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,889
You want a turn?

653
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:35,889
The water's great!

654
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:38,766
Time to see if it worked.

655
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,643
Fluttershy, oh,

656
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:40,643
there you are.

657
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,520
A sight

658
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,520
for sore eyes.

659
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,189
As you can see, there's

660
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:45,189
a big mess down here

661
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,649
at Sweet Apple Acres

662
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,528
Oh yes, awful business

663
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,528
that, mm-hm.

664
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:52,030
It is awful.

665
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,156
This is Applejack's home

666
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,156
and it's being destroyed

667
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,659
by innocent creatures who would

668
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,659
never be acting this way

669
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,038
if it weren't for your

670
00:17:56,784 --> 00:18:00,038
reckless behavior.

671
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,041
You need to fix this.

672
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,167
Well, yes. Very well,

673
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,167
I will fix it.

674
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,046
I only ask one thing

675
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,046
in return.

676
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,672
Yes?

677
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,927
I ask that you never use your

678
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:13,927
Element of Harmony against me.

679
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,178
As a sign of our friendship.

680
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:25,646
I will never use my Element

681
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:25,646
of Harmony against you.

682
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,148
Excellent!

683
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,028
DISCORD:

684
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,028
There, much better!

685
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:37,157
I do prefer ice skating

686
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:37,157
to water skiing, don't you?

687
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,660
La da da dee dee ta!

688
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,912
Discord!

689
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,289
That's not fixing it!

690
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,793
Why I ought to--

691
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,545
Where are you going?

692
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,797
What's wrong, pal?

693
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,548
Don't call me

694
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:52,548
your pal!

695
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:54,174
Pshaw!

696
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,054
Come skating with me, and

697
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,054
we'll let bygones be bygones!

698
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,183
Here you go,

699
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,183
Fluttershy. Game on!

700
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,937
He fixes this, or he goes

701
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,937
back to being stone.

702
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,439
TWILIGHT:

703
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,439
Princess Celestia

704
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:08,439
will understand.

705
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,030
I made a promise not to use my

706
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,030
Element against him,

707
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,907
and I'm going to keep it.

708
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,786
( groans )

709
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,788
Ha, ha!

710
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,166
You see? She wants to have fun

711
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:27,166
with me because we're friends.

712
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,918
She can't use the elements

713
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,918
against me

714
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:30,795
because we're friends!

715
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,674
I'm free forever,

716
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,674
ha, ha, ha!

717
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,925
( growling )

718
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,928
Not! Your! Friend!

719
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:43,057
Who cares? I can do whatever

720
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:43,057
I want, whenever I want.

721
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,561
I'm Discord,

722
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:47,561
the Master of Chaos!

723
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,563
You think you can boss

724
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:49,563
Discord around?

725
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,191
You think I'm just going

726
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,191
to turn all this back

727
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,068
because you say so?

728
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,322
Because if I don't, I'll lose

729
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,322
the one friend I ever had?

730
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:02,201
( sighs )

731
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,706
DISCORD:

732
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,706
Oh...

733
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:09,167
Well played, Fluttershy.

734
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,668
Well played.

735
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:22,805
( triumphant music playing )

736
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,936
PONIES:

737
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,936
Woo-hoo!

738
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,936
All right, Fluttershy!

739
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,312
I liked it better

740
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,312
my way,

741
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,190
but I guess when

742
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,190
you're friends,

743
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,067
you can't always have things

744
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,067
exactly your way

745
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,195
all the time, eh?.

746
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,447
( peaceful music playing )

747
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,825
Yes, Princess.

748
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,825
I'm ready to use my magic

749
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,703
for good instead

750
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:45,703
of evil.

751
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,329
( muttering ):

752
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,329
Most of the time.

753
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,957
PRINCESS CELESTIA:

754
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,957
Congratulations

755
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,957
on your success, ponies.

756
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:54,087
I definitely sense

757
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:54,087
a big change in Discord.

758
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,090
I'll leave the Elements

759
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,090
of Harmony with you, Twilight.

760
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:58,841
Just in case.

761
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,803
You were right when you said

762
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,803
Fluttershy would be

763
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,305
the one to find a way

764
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,305
to reform Discord.

765
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,308
By treating Discord as a friend,

766
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:08,308
she got him to realize

767
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,437
that friendship was actually

768
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:11,437
important to him.

769
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:15,816
And something that, once he had,

770
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:15,816
he didn't want to lose.

771
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,318
Go on, say it.

772
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,446
Oh, all right.

773
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,949
( rushing ):

774
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,949
Friendship is magic.

775
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:29,580
