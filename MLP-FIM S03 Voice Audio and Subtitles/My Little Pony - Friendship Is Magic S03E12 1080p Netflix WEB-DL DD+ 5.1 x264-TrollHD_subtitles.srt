00:00:01,961 --> 00:00:03,044
(<i> upbeat theme playing</i> )

2
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,421
( train engine chugging )

3
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,007
You absolutely sure

4
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,007
you can do this?

5
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,176
Of course. Wouldn't have agreed

6
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:09,176
to it if I couldn't.

7
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:10,427
Piece of cake.

8
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:12,095
Speaking of cake,

9
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,264
I've got a little something

10
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,264
I need to attend to.

11
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,351
Yeah, like keeping an eye

12
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,351
on a house full of critters.

13
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:21,689
Uh, yeah, that was totally

14
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:21,689
what I was talking about.

15
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,983
Relax.

16
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,983
Go do your welcoming thing

17
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,233
in the Crystal Empire.

18
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,986
Spike's got it all

19
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,986
under control.

20
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,827
( Opal screeching

21
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,827
and Winona barking )

22
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,746
Hurry up, Twilight,

23
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,746
we can't miss our train!

24
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,414
Tickets.

25
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,208
APPLEJACK:

26
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,208
Oh, this is gonna be

27
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:41,208
a real treat.

28
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,835
Princess Cadance said

29
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:42,835
she's never seen

30
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,545
the Crystal Ponies

31
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,545
so excited.

32
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,214
RAINBOW DASH:

33
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,214
Duh.

34
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,214
Of course they're excited.

35
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,174
They're up

36
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:49,174
for the Equestria Games.

37
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,092
It's only the biggest

38
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,092
sporting event

39
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:52,887
in all of Equestria.

40
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,681
Didn't Cloudsdale host

41
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:55,681
the Equestria Games one year?

42
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,393
No. Cloudsdale should've hosted

43
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:59,393
the games one year.

44
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,271
I'll never forget

45
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,271
when we got the bad news.

46
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,819
GAMES ANNOUNCER PONY:

47
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,819
The Equestria Games go to

48
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:12,447
the city of Phillydelphia.

49
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,576
No!

50
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,997
These Crystal Ponies

51
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,997
lost a thousand years

52
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,916
to an evil king's curse.

53
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,251
They've had enough bad news.

54
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:24,251
No way we're letting them

55
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,128
experience the pain

56
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:27,128
of losing out on these games.

57
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,007
Exactly. Princess Cadance

58
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:30,007
is counting on us

59
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,217
to do our part to convince

60
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,217
the Games Inspector

61
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,677
to choose

62
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,677
the Crystal Empire.

63
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,764
And we are not

64
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,764
gonna let her down, are we?

65
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:41,643
No!

66
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:45,397
What? I was just answering

67
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:45,397
Twilight's question.

68
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:51,028

PONIES:

88
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,813
Four, three, two, one.

89
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,606
The Crystal Empire,

90
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,606
that's the one!

91
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,817
Okay, everypony. Great job.

92
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,276
Sounds like we're ready.

93
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,570
( all speaking

94
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,570
indistinctly )

95
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:37,157
One more time. From the top.

96
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,408
Oh.

97
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,408
Oh, please.

98
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:39,952
I think that was perfect.

99
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,329
Agh. But we've run this

100
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,329
like 12 times already.

101
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:43,664
I think we've got it.

102
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,332
Cadance said

103
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,332
the Games Inspector

104
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,501
really puts folks through

105
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,501
the ringer on her visits.

106
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,336
There's no margin for error

107
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,336
here.

108
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,672
And this time, we need

109
00:02:49,461 --> 00:02:51,672
to practice the steps.

110
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,841
On a train car?

111
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,510
You heard the pony.

112
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,510
On your hooves.

113
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,054
ALL:

114
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,054
Two, four, six, eight.

115
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,015
( rumbling

116
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,015
and all screaming )

117
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:04,726
Crystal Empire, ladies.

118
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,604
Watch your step

119
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,604
leaving the train.

120
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:09,815
( sighs )

121
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,274
Probably should've watched

122
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,274
our step

123
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,609
while we were still

124
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:12,609
on it too.

125
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,736
( engine chugging )

126
00:03:18,115 --> 00:03:19,533
Wow!

127
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,452
The Crystal Empire looks

128
00:03:19,658 --> 00:03:22,452
crystalier than ever!

129
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,376
APPLEJACK:

130
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,376
They must have everypony

131
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:29,376
in the Empire

132
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,170
out sprucing it up.

133
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,463
TWILIGHT:

134
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,463
This must be why

135
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,463
were asked us to handle

136
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,298
the welcome committee

137
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,298
routine.

138
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,094
And it's probably also because

139
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,094
we'll be awesome at it.

140
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,888
Princess Cadance was right.

141
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,682
These ponies do look

142
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:43,682
pretty darn excited.

143
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,601
Yup.

144
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:46,601
I remember that feeling.

145
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,395
But not as much

146
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,395
as I remember

147
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,397
the crushing wave

148
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,397
of disappointment that came

149
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,107
when things didn't work out.

150
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,734
RAINBOW DASH:

151
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,734
That right there.

152
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,071
That is the face

153
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:57,071
I do not want to see.

154
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,823
APPLEJACK:

155
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:59,823
Uh, mm-hm.

156
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,206
We're here.

157
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,374
Ha, ha,

158
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,374
there are my girls.

159
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,086
CADANCE & TWILIGHT:

160
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,086
<i>Sunshine, sunshine</i>

161
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,086
<i>Ladybugs awake</i>

162
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,046
<i>Clap your hooves</i>

163
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:14,046
<i>And do a little shake</i>

164
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,463
( Twilight and Cadance

165
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,463
giggling )

166
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:18,466
Oh, my, this is spectacular.

167
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,595
Please, everypony, stand back.

168
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,595
I need air.

169
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,555
Go ahead

170
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,555
and try whatever you like.

171
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,724
It's all complimentary

172
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,724
for the welcome committee.

173
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,017
( giggles )

174
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,103
That over there

175
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,103
is a crystal mud bath,

176
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,313
which relaxes your body

177
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,313
and rejuvenates your coat.

178
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,026
Now, I realize it can be kind

179
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:36,026
of strange to climb into mud,

180
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,778
but if you'll just give it

181
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,778
a chance, I'm sure--

182
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,029
PINKIE PIE:

183
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:39,029
Whoo-hoo!

184
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,280
Pinkie! No!

185
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,990
( Pinkie Pie laughing )

186
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:43,242
( sighs )

187
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:44,993
So relaxing.

188
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,246
Pinkie Pie! Honestly.

189
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,541
BOTH:

190
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,541
Hmph.

191
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,502
( both sigh )

192
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,797
Go ahead.

193
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,797
Have a good time

194
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,466
while I get my ceremonial

195
00:04:56,922 --> 00:04:59,466
headdress done.

196
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,094
Ceremonial headdress?

197
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,929
When meeting

198
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,929
with important guests,

199
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,306
it was tradition for rulers

200
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,306
of the Crystal Empire

201
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,016
to weave crystals

202
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,016
into their manes

203
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,768
in a very specific way.

204
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,604
The Games Inspector is known

205
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:12,604
for doing her homework.

206
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,231
She'll certainly be expecting

207
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,231
my look

208
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,066
to reflect the importance

209
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:16,066
of her visit.

210
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,358
( door opens )

211
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:18,610
Princess.

212
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:21,155
If I may have a word.

213
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,364
I have two pieces of news

214
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,364
for you.

215
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,117
First, your mane-stylist

216
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,117
has the flu

217
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,367
and won't be able

218
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,367
to make it

219
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,203
for fear

220
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,203
of you catching it too.

221
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,831
Oh, well...

222
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,666
I hope she's better soon.

223
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,876
Do any of the other

224
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,876
stylists here know

225
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,420
how to do the traditional

226
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,420
royal ceremonial headdress?

227
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,631
( all indistinctly

228
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:39,631
chattering )

229
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,049
Oh.

230
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,301
( sighs)

231
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,470
Just a small detail.

232
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,139
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

233
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,641
You're trying to land

234
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,641
the Equestria Games here.

235
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,977
There's no such thing

236
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,977
as a small detail.

237
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:53,352
Rainbow Dash.

238
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,064
I suppose

239
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:56,064
I could give it a shot.

240
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,900
Oh, Rarity,

241
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,900
you would do that for me?

242
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,735
Way to step up, Rare.

243
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,279
Fortunately,

244
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,282
I have all the precise

245
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:05,282
instructions right here.

246
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,120
RARITY:

247
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,120
Oh, my.

248
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,955
You sure

249
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:11,955
you're up to this?

250
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,916
Working on the hair of royalty

251
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,916
on such an auspicious occasion

252
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,793
is the opportunity

253
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,793
of a lifetime.

254
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,377
I will give it everything

255
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,377
I've got.

256
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,922
See? No worries.

257
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,217
Besides, the Games Inspector

258
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,217
isn't expected

259
00:06:23,342 --> 00:06:24,843
for several hours.

260
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,845
I'll have plenty of time

261
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:26,845
to figure out exactly

262
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,471
how to do this.

263
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,016
Oh, Rarity,

264
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,016
that's wonderful.

265
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,476
You said you had a second

266
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,476
bit of news?

267
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,020
Yes, quite.

268
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,064
The Games Inspector,

269
00:06:35,145 --> 00:06:37,064
Ms. Harshwhinny,

270
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,607
will be arriving

271
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,607
on the next train.

272
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,235
ALL:

273
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,235
What?

274
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,571
What? You couldn't have

275
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,571
told her that news first?

276
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,822
That's 15 minutes

277
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,822
from now!

278
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,074
FLUTTERSHY:

279
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,074
Oh, my goodness.

280
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,407
( Rainbow Dash gasping )

281
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,369
( gasps then sighs )

282
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,620
How long before Cadance

283
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,620
is ready?

284
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:53,914
Hmm...

285
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,582
I'm sure to find

286
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:55,582
some shortcuts.

287
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,542
Can you have her back

288
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,542
at the castle when we're done?

289
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,793
Done.

290
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,670
Okay, we'll be fine.

291
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,881
TWILIGHT:

292
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,881
Everypony,

293
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,881
just be on the lookout

294
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,092
for the pony

295
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:05,092
with the flower print luggage.

296
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,095
PINKIE PIE

297
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,095
Easy peasy,

298
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:08,095
pudding in the freezy.

299
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,513
We bring the Games Inspector

300
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,513
back to the castle,

301
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,558
put on our big welcome committee

302
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:13,558
how-do-you-do, and then--

303
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,352
Put the pudding out to thaw

304
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,352
before you eat it

305
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,603
or you'll crack a tooth?

306
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,355
I'll just ignore that.

307
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:19,647
We need to remember

308
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,858
that the Games Inspector

309
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,858
arriving early

310
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,736
is probably part of a plan

311
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,736
to psych us out.

312
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,529
What do you mean?

313
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:26,529
You said it yourself.

314
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,865
She's got a rep for trying

315
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,865
to catch hosts off guard.

316
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,534
Just to see if we can handle

317
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,534
the kind of massive pressure

318
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,745
that comes with hosting

319
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,745
the Equestria Games.

320
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,581
Oh, no,

321
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,581
we're gonna blow it.

322
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,792
Not if we always stay

323
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,792
one step ahead

324
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,086
and don't fall

325
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:41,086
for any of her mind games.

326
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,629
Anything she throws at us,

327
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,505
we just need to remember

328
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,505
she's testing us,

329
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,967
and roll with it.

330
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,936
Excuse me, ma'am?

331
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:00,563
Yes? What is it?

332
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,773
Oh, no.

333
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,108
Be cool.

334
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,734
Well, I know

335
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,734
you're not expecting us

336
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,820
but we're here

337
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,820
to personally welcome you

338
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,822
to the Crystal Empire.

339
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,243
The whole lot of you

340
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,243
came to do that?

341
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:16,788
Uh, well, um, yes.

342
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,959
Well, darn tootin'!

343
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:20,959
Ain't that the cat's meow.

344
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,419
Y'all didn't need

345
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,419
to do that.

346
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,380
Why, I hardly expected

347
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:25,380
anything like this.

348
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,965
( sighs )

349
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,842
The princess wouldn't

350
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,842
have had it any other way.

351
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,552
The Princess?

352
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:31,552
Princess Cadance?

353
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:32,804
None other.

354
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,723
Well, tie me up

355
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,723
and throw me down.

356
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,143
This just keeps getting

357
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,143
better and better.

358
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,978
Can we help you

359
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,978
with your bags?

360
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:41,313
Don't mind if you do.

361
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,981
Ooh! I love flower print.

362
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,565
( squishing )

363
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:46,151
Sorry.

364
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,612
PINKIE PIE:

365
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,612
Our first stop is the castle

366
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,240
where we've got a big

367
00:08:49,737 --> 00:08:52,240
razzamatazzy welcome

368
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:53,492
planned for you.

369
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,286
The castle?

370
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:56,286
Are you kidding?

371
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,205
Hot diggity dog!

372
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,374
See that?

373
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,374
Just gotta roll with it

374
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,959
until the Princess gets there

375
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:02,959
and we'll be just fine.

376
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,128
( engine chugging )

377
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,505
(<i> slow theme playing</i> )

378
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,553
( hair dryer whirring )

379
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,640
CADANCE:

380
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,640
So how's it going so far?

381
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,936
Oh, I'm so sorry.

382
00:09:17,765 --> 00:09:21,936
It's just all so complicated.

383
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,313
( chuckles )

384
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,649
I can fix it.

385
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,649
CADANCE: Fix what?

386
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,361
Well,

387
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,361
I was looking for shortcuts

388
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,863
and I thought

389
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:31,863
step 12 was optional.

390
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,823
But it's not.

391
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,918
GAMES INSPECTOR:

392
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,918
My golly,

393
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,918
the Crystal Castle!

394
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,586
Why, I've seen pictures,

395
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,216
but I never expected to see it

396
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:51,216
with my very own eyes!

397
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,467
( gulps )

398
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,969
From the inside.

399
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:58,223
Oh, my gosh, she's so nice.

400
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,516
You're letting her

401
00:09:58,348 --> 00:09:59,516
lull you

402
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,017
into a false sense

403
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,017
of confidence.

404
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,896
Watch that.

405
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:04,896
It's all part of the game.

406
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,441
Oh, my, I'm so excited.

407
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,484
TWILIGHT:

408
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,484
Please have a seat,

409
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,484
won't you?

410
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,112
Mind if I take a quick run

411
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:12,112
outside first.

412
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,905
It was an awfully long

413
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,905
train ride

414
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,241
and my legs could use

415
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,241
a stretch.

416
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,327
Oh, well,

417
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:19,327
we were just about to start.

418
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,912
Oh, never you mind.

419
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,872
You go on ahead.

420
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,872
I'm listening.

421
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,583
She was probably testing us

422
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,626
to see

423
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,626
if we could remain in control

424
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,378
of a complex situation.

425
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,671
Looks like we passed.

426
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,671
Bump.

427
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,382
Yeah.

428
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,218
We'd like to thank you

429
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,218
for this opportunity

430
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,096
to introduce you

431
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,096
to this wonderful kingdom.

432
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,390
Oh, well,

433
00:10:38,221 --> 00:10:40,390
the pleasure is all mine.

434
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,976
And since we're not even

435
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:42,976
from here ourselves,

436
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,811
who better than us

437
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,811
to let you know

438
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,522
just how welcoming

439
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:47,522
this place can be?

440
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,899
ALL ( chanting ):

441
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,899
<i>Two, four, six, eight</i>

442
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,692
<i>Name a place</i>

443
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,692
<i>That's really great</i>

444
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,194
<i>One, two, three, four</i>

445
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,029
<i>And keeps you coming back</i>

446
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,029
<i>For more</i>

447
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:56,697
<i>Two, seven, nine, three</i>

448
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,617
<i>The place that we'd all</i>

449
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,617
<i>Wanna be</i>

450
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,160
<i>Four, three, two, one</i>

451
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,953
<i>The Crystal Empire</i>

452
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,953
<i>That's the one</i>

453
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,538
( fireworks expoding )

454
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,374
( cheering and whistling )

455
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,251
( all panting )

456
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,710
GAMES INSPECTOR:

457
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,710
Oh!

458
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,964
I tell you,

459
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,964
I have traveled far and wide,

460
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,050
but I have never,

461
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,050
ever been welcomed anyplace

462
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,512
in the fashion that you all

463
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:18,512
have done here today.

464
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,180
That's fantastic.

465
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,266
Princess Cadance would be

466
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:23,266
so glad to hear that.

467
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:24,809
Honestly, I'm surprised

468
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,936
she knows anything

469
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,936
about me at all.

470
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,272
Of course she does.

471
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,732
She's been looking forward

472
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,732
to your visit for weeks.

473
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,235
Oh, goodie. Is she here?

474
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:35,529
Uh...

475
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,155
Where the heck is she

476
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:37,155
anyway?

477
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,698
Wasn't she supposed

478
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,698
to be here by now?

479
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,535
Oh, that's all right.

480
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,994
(<i> suspenseful theme</i>

481
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,994
<i>playing</i> )

482
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,663
( gulps )

483
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,873
Maybe-- I'll just take

484
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,873
my little run outside now.

485
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:49,334
( panting )

486
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:51,545
Or, if you like,

487
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,463
we could give you a tour

488
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,463
of the castle.

489
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,840
RAINBOW DASH:

490
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,840
That way,

491
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:55,840
you could be learning

492
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,426
and stretching

493
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,426
all at the same time.

494
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,555
Oh, a tour

495
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,555
of the Crystal Castle.

496
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,264
I'd love that a whole heap.

497
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,850
Dash, we've hardly ever

498
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,850
even been here before.

499
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,977
It's just another test.

500
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,397
We gotta roll with it,

501
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:10,397
remember?

502
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:12,899
Ooh, let me give the tour.

503
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,068
PINKIE PIE:

504
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,068
I'll do it, I'll do it.

505
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,068
Let me, let me, let me.

506
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:16,486
( sighs )

507
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,112
Fine. You will start

508
00:12:16,611 --> 00:12:18,112
giving her the tour

509
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,907
and I'll go see

510
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:20,907
what's keeping Cadance.

511
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,035
(<i> upbeat theme playing</i> )

512
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,787
( groans then grunts )

513
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:28,206
Hello there.

514
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,748
Hello yourself.

515
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,001
First hello of the day.

516
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,253
Oh. Ugh.

517
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,213
( grunting )

518
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,673
( Twilight humming )

519
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,676
Aah!

520
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:39,676
What are you doing here?

521
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,344
We finished

522
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,344
the welcome committee song

523
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,555
and we just wanted to introduce

524
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,555
Ms. Harshwinny to--

525
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,140
No, no. Princess Cadance

526
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,140
isn't ready.

527
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,309
Something's gone

528
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,309
terribly wrong.

529
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,936
TWILIGHT:

530
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,936
I need to speak

531
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,936
to the princess.

532
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,312
RARITY:

533
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:51,312
You can't, mustn't.

534
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,022
She's in a delicate

535
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,022
conditioning rinse

536
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,815
that must go perfectly

537
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,815
if there's to be any hope

538
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,025
for her hair.

539
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,111
TWILIGHT:

540
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,111
Come on. How bad could it be?

541
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,863
Imagine her mane

542
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:00,863
turned into a porcupine.

543
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,574
Oh.

544
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,951
Please, I'll bring her back

545
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,951
from the brink of tragedy,

546
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,785
but you have got to buy me

547
00:13:05,076 --> 00:13:06,785
some time.

548
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,871
There's no other way.

549
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,499
So you see, this here,

550
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,499
this, um--

551
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,501
This is, um...

552
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,754
A big round room.

553
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,090
It's known

554
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,090
for its roundness and bigness.

555
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,801
And did I mention

556
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:22,801
that it's round?

557
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,971
I think they call it

558
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,971
a rotunda,

559
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:28,141
a small, confining rotunda.

560
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,684
Pfft. Whatever.

561
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,394
Round is round, am I right?

562
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,853
Easy, Pinkie.

563
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,105
Let's play this safe.

564
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,565
We got her in a good mood,

565
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,191
so let's not do anything

566
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,191
to ruin that.

567
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,737
You know, I love

568
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,737
this sort of architecture.

569
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,073
I detect a neo-gothic

570
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,073
inspiration in the design, yes?

571
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,910
Hey, look at me.

572
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,622
( babbles )

573
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,874
( sighs )

574
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,460
And not a moment too soon.

575
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,545
Where's Cadance?

576
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,545
Tell me she's right behind you.

577
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,714
There's a bit of a problem

578
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,714
with her headdress.

579
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:01,048
How's it going here?

580
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,425
Boingie boingie boingie.

581
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,387
I, uh, hate

582
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,387
to be a bother,

583
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,846
but the legs

584
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:07,846
are cramping up on me

585
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,474
with all

586
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,474
this standing around.

587
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,850
Huh?

588
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,850
She's getting bored,

589
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,395
and we have to buy Rarity

590
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,395
some more time.

591
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,896
( sighs )

592
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,191
I'll see if Shining Armor

593
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,191
can come help.

594
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,361
Can't one of you other ponies

595
00:14:18,316 --> 00:14:21,361
take over in the meantime?

596
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,488
I got this.

597
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,406
Wanna stretch your legs,

598
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,406
huh?

599
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,284
Well, whatever you need,

600
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:28,284
I'm sure we can provide.

601
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,245
Let's just make our way

602
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,245
to the castle's gymnasium.

603
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,164
Our tour

604
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,164
will now be headed--

605
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,837
This way.

606
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,673
And we're walking,

607
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,673
and we're walking.

608
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,800
( Twilight humming )

609
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:51,891
( all speaking

610
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:51,891
indistinctly )

611
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,142
Twiley.

612
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,728
Hello there.

613
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,522
Shining Armor,

614
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:57,522
you've gotta help me.

615
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,192
Everything okay?

616
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,192
I left the other ponies behind

617
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,195
giving the Games Inspector

618
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,195
the worst castle tour ever.

619
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,780
SHINING ARMOR:

620
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,780
Come on, gang!

621
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,449
Are we gonna gallop

622
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:08,449
or are we gonna trot?

623
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,117
A castle tour, huh?

624
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,078
I'm pretty sure I can give you

625
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,078
a hoof with that.

626
00:15:12,203 --> 00:15:14,247
Let's move, move, move!

627
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,915
Everything's gonna be

628
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,915
okay.

629
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,419
I know. I'm not worried.

630
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:22,422
I'm not worried, it worked.

631
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:23,673
( sighs then screams )

632
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:25,091
I'm outside.

633
00:15:25,216 --> 00:15:26,384
( laughing )

634
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,845
Feels so good

635
00:15:26,509 --> 00:15:28,845
to stretch the old legs.

636
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,471
What the-- ?

637
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,433
Turns out the Crystal Castle

638
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,433
doesn't have a gymnasium.

639
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,642
Watch it!

640
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:36,018
( Games Inspector screams )

641
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,062
Make her stop.

642
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,481
Wait.

643
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,481
That's the Games Inspector.

644
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,775
Let her do her thing.

645
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,068
Good, oh, these hooves,

646
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,068
I'm outside.

647
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,653
Why would she do that?

648
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,987
I have no idea.

649
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,031
But that's why

650
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,031
she's in charge

651
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,950
of choosing who gets the games

652
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:50,950
and we're not. Heh.

653
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,326
( crashing )

654
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,331
Aah! Oh.

655
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,959
Get me outside

656
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,959
for a run.

657
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,002
Look out!

658
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,964
Yeah. Okay.

659
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,964
We need to stop her.

660
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,091
( Games Inspector

661
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:07,091
screaming )

662
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,767
Where is she going

663
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:15,767
in such a hurry?

664
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,977
GAMES INSPECTOR:

665
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:17,977
Ah. Oh, yeah!

666
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,939
Closer, closer,

667
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:22,899
I think we got her.

668
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,734
GAMES INSPECTOR:

669
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,734
Oh!

670
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,278
( Rainbow Dash screams )

671
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,363
( scratching on glass )

672
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:33,910
Whoo-wee!

673
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,870
That felt good.

674
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,288
Nothing like a great run

675
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,415
to shake the cobwebs

676
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,415
off these old bones.

677
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,667
( Rainbow Dash panting )

678
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,126
Hey there, Speedy.

679
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,797
Oh! These wide open spaces

680
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,797
you all got here

681
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,047
remind me of home.

682
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:48,800
This is great.

683
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,846
Oh, so you're enjoying

684
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:52,846
your visit.

685
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:56,140
Oh, I'm so glad.

686
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,934
Oh, good golly, yes.

687
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,269
I just love to travel

688
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,269
and see new places.

689
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,564
Such a beautiful spot

690
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,564
you got here too.

691
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,942
Why, thank you so much.

692
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,360
I'm Shining Armor.

693
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,487
Oh. The prince.

694
00:17:09,612 --> 00:17:11,071
What's going on?

695
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,533
From the looks of it,

696
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,533
just locking up the games

697
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,451
for the Crystal Empire,

698
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,451
is all.

699
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,328
Ain't no thing.

700
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,579
My, oh, my.

701
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,499
I never met a prince before.

702
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,584
Ha-ha-ha. I'm surprised.

703
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,878
I'd think

704
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,878
in your line of work

705
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,546
you'd meet princes

706
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:26,546
all the time.

707
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:31,342
Hardly, just an ordinary

708
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:31,342
Wild Mustang from Mustangia

709
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,387
here to enjoy

710
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,387
a little vacay.

711
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,139
Never thought I'd also

712
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,139
be meeting royalty to boot.

713
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,308
( giggles )

714
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:41,728
You are Ms. Harshwhinny,

715
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:45,147
the Equestria Games Inspector,

716
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:45,147
aren't you?

717
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,984
Inspector of what now?

718
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,235
(<i> suspenseful theme</i>

719
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,235
<i>playing</i> )

720
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,613
We got the wrong pony?

721
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:56,450
No!

722
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,161
I mean, yes!

723
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:01,581
( panting )

724
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,918
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

725
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,419
APPLEJACK:

726
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:06,419
Oh, please, still be here.

727
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,170
Oh, please, oh, please,

728
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,170
oh, please.

729
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,214
There's got to be

730
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,214
another pony

731
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,759
with flower print luggage

732
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,759
around here somewhere.

733
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:15,302
Except that there isn't.

734
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,346
We've gotta find her

735
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:17,346
before Cadance finds out

736
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,890
what a mess

737
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,890
we've made of things.

738
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,600
Okay, here's what we do:

739
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,936
We split the empire up

740
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,936
into five sectors.

741
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,812
Each of us search a sector.

742
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,023
Well, except for the spa.

743
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,441
What's the point

744
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,441
of checking there?

745
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,234
That's where Cadance is.

746
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,946
If Ms. Harshwhinny is there,

747
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,946
well, then game over. Right?

748
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,781
( all gasp )

749
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,991
HARSHWHINNY:

750
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,991
Every city in the empire

751
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:36,991
wants to host

752
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,576
the Equestria Games.

753
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:39,994
So I have to go through

754
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,829
all the big phoney baloney

755
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,829
song and dance,

756
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,707
though of course I'm never

757
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,707
getting the real inside scoop.

758
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,418
TOURIST:

759
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,418
Oh, golly.

760
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,670
I've been having a swell time

761
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,670
since I got here.

762
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,381
I'm actually thinking

763
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:52,381
of extending my stay.

764
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,843
And what exactly has made

765
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,843
your visit so "special"?

766
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,138
Oh, gosh, where to start?

767
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,809
Oh, there she is.

768
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,394
We're in luck, I don't think

769
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,394
either of them knows yet

770
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,771
that the other one's here.

771
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:10,691
Wonderful news.

772
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,193
Look, Princess Cadance,

773
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:13,193
better than new.

774
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:16,405
Princess Cadance?

775
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,365
So this is where you've been.

776
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,993
I will have you know

777
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,828
this is by far

778
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:21,828
the worst welcome I've had

779
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,329
in all my years.

780
00:19:23,454 --> 00:19:25,372
I can't believe it.

781
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,916
What was wrong

782
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,916
with your welcome?

783
00:19:27,041 --> 00:19:28,876
There wasn't one.

784
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,920
What is going on?

785
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,716
Princess, we gave our welcome

786
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:35,716
to the wrong pony,

787
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,218
left the right one

788
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,218
waiting at the station,

789
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,263
and completely

790
00:19:38,344 --> 00:19:41,263
ruined everything.

791
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:45,726
Cinnamon bun?

792
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:47,561
When I was a little filly,

793
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,230
I wanted so badly

794
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,230
for Cloudsdale to win

795
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:51,524
the Equestria Games.

796
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:53,776
But it didn't happen.

797
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,987
So I thought I could make up

798
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,987
for that disappointment

799
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,697
by helping the Crystal Empire

800
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:57,697
win the chance

801
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,198
to host the games.

802
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,618
But it looks like I ruined

803
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:02,618
your chances instead.

804
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,286
Not so fast, Speedy.

805
00:20:05,121 --> 00:20:06,246
I just finished hearing

806
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,665
about how this pony

807
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:07,665
was just treated

808
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:08,875
to the warmest,

809
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,168
funnest,

810
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,378
most fabulous reception

811
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,378
she ever had.

812
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:13,754
Darn tootin'.

813
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,382
Courtesy of these fine ponies

814
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,382
right here.

815
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:18,258
Which, in my expert opinion,

816
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,970
amounts to the first ever

817
00:20:18,384 --> 00:20:20,970
unvarnished, unrehearsed,

818
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,723
and unbiased appraisal

819
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:23,723
of a potential host

820
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,017
of the Equestria Games.

821
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,227
Which can only mean

822
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,227
one thing.

823
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,438
The next host

824
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,438
of the Equestria Games

825
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:33,191
is The Crystal Empire!

826
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,441
( crowd cheers )

827
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,776
RAINBOW DASH:

828
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,776
We did it.

829
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:39,488
CADANCE:

830
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:39,488
Congratulations,

831
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:39,488
Crystal Ponies.

832
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,164
You know it feels good

833
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,164
to help others get something

834
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,957
you always wanted

835
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,957
but never had.

836
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,585
Almost as good

837
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:52,585
as getting it yourself.

838
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,420
Almost.

839
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,922
We'll still be able

840
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,922
to come back here

841
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,631
and watch the games

842
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,631
when they're played.

843
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,843
You're right. That'll rock.

844
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:04,972
Oh, my goodness.

845
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,307
CONDUCTOR:

846
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:07,307
All aboard.

847
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,601
Ha! Huh, Bummer,

848
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:09,894
Spike had to miss out

849
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:09,894
on all this.

850
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,311
He would've had fun here.

851
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,355
I'm sure he's having

852
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:13,355
a great time

853
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,066
watching all the critters

854
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,066
back at home.

855
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,026
Think he's still

856
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,026
got a handle on things?

857
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:18,318
( sighs )

858
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,529
If he's staying calm

859
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:20,529
and collected,

860
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,574
I bet he's doing

861
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,574
a terrific job as a leader.

862
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,077
( growling )

863
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,913
You all hear that?

864
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:30,289
