1
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:06,298
Ah, found them.

2
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,678
( sneezes )

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:10,678
Gesund-hoof.

4
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,555
Why, thank you,

5
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:13,555
Applejack.

6
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,100
I still can't believe

7
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,100
it's been almost 100 moons

8
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,478
since our last

9
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:19,478
family reunion.

10
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,564
Oh, I remember it

11
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,564
like it was yesterday.

12
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,316
Well, you have been

13
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,316
talking about it

14
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,318
pretty much every day

15
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,318
since then.

16
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,571
Apple Bloom, how are them

17
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,571
RSVPs coming along?

18
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,324
Who's showing their muzzle

19
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:32,324
at the reunion?

20
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,951
Everypony.

21
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,620
Everypony?

22
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,620
Feathers on a goat.

23
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,872
Are you sure?

24
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,332
Well, I got RSVPs from

25
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,960
Apples from Yonderhill,

26
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,960
Hollow Shades,

27
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,879
Galloping Gorge,

28
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:44,879
Foal Mountains,

29
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,715
Apples from Fillydelphia,

30
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,715
Tall Tale Town,

31
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,009
and all the Apples

32
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,009
from Apple-Loosa.

33
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,259
Huh?

34
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,720
Oh, and how could

35
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,720
I forget?

36
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,263
Mane-hattan.

37
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:55,263
Babs is coming.

38
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,599
I get to see

39
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,599
my favorite cousin.

40
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,978
I think we're gonna need

41
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,978
a bigger cider trough.

the family's grown tenfold

65

since the last reunion.

66
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,025
I'm gonna be busier than

67
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,025
a worm in a rotten tomato

68
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,069
trying to get

69
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,069
everything ready.

70
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,445
I could

71
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,445
always help out.

72
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,280
Me too.

73
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,280
Yup.

74
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,033
Oh, I sure would

75
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:56,033
appreciate that.

76
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,285
Granny's a little rustier

77
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,285
in the giddyap

78
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,538
since the last time

79
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,538
the Apples all got together.

80
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,961
You may be a tad old, Granny,

81
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,921
but you're as feisty

82
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:08,921
and full of spark as ever.

83
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:10,798
Who you calling old?

84
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,300
I-- I just meant, why don't you

85
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,300
let me take over

86
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,552
putting the reunion together

87
00:02:13,425 --> 00:02:15,552
this time around?

88
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,305
Then all you'll need to worry

89
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,305
about is enjoying yourself.

90
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,724
Hmm. All right,

91
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,724
young 'un.

92
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,061
You got yourself a deal.

93
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:24,061
You are in charge.

94
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,729
I won't

95
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,729
let you down, Granny.

96
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,064
You just tell me what

97
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,064
the reunion needs,

98
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,690
and I'll take care

99
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:28,690
of the rest.

100
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,069
I'll do better than tell you

101
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,069
what the reunion will need.

102
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,696
I'll show you.

103
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,116
We've been hosting these things

104
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,116
at Sweet Apple Acres

105
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,700
every 100 moons

106
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,953
since we first planted roots

107
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:40,953
here in Ponyville.

108
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:42,621
Hey, who's that?

109
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,582
That'd be your great great

110
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:45,582
Auntie Applesauce

111
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,459
when she was just

112
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,459
about your age.

113
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,628
Now she used to go by

114
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,628
another name,

115
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,964
but everypony

116
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,964
started calling her Applesauce

117
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,382
after half her teeth fell out

118
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:54,382
when she was making apple jam.

119
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,845
Yeah. Never did find

120
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:57,845
them teeth in all those jars.

121
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,221
Hey, that's you, Granny.

122
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,099
GRANNY:

123
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,099
Sure is.

124
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,226
Apple family's been working

125
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,226
on that same old quilt

126
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,271
since our first reunion.

127
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:09,773
I can do it.

128
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:19,741
Oh, fingle-fangle.

129
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,039
Well, nopony told me

130
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,999
you actually had to knot

131
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,999
the end of the thread.

132
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,376
Okay, so I'll need to get

133
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,376
new quilting materials.

134
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,294
Fabric, needles, thread.

135
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,755
You've really been

136
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,755
working on the same quilt

137
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,757
since the first reunion?

138
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,885
Surely have.

139
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,388
I don't think we're ever gonna

140
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,388
finish that doggone thing.

141
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,390
Hey, what's going on

142
00:03:41,513 --> 00:03:43,390
here?

143
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,892
GRANNY:

144
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:44,892
Well, you know us Apples

145
00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,518
enjoy a good fritter.

146
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:52,315
Ooh! Hot, hot, hot.

147
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:00,574
Hey, where'd all them

148
00:03:57,071 --> 00:04:00,574
apple fritters go?

149
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,910
And, who are you,

150
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,910
little one?

151
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,787
I'm Applejack.

152
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,787
More apple fritter?

153
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,916
GRANNY:

154
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,916
That's how we figured out

155
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,293
your sister had the appetite

156
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,293
of a full-grown stallion.

157
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,213
Better get twice as much

158
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,213
honey and flour, then,

159
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:18,466
50 more buckets of apples,

160
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:18,466
more oil, wood for the fire.

161
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,220
Now, stick an apple in my mouth

162
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,220
and roast my rump.

163
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,431
This one sure

164
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,431
brings back memories.

165
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,101
You know how Babs

166
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:27,101
is your favorite cousin?

167
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,436
Well, Apple Rose is mine.

168
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,605
The two of us

169
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,605
entered the seven-legged race

170
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,607
every reunion.

171
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,483
We're gonna win this one,

172
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,483
cousin.

173
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,946
You bet your hot diggity

174
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,946
derriere we are.

175
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,322
Come on, cousin,

176
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:41,322
speed it on up.

177
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,575
( upbeat theme playing )

178
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,079
Whoa!

179
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,463
Never won a single one

180
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,463
of them races.

181
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,340
Races. We'll need

182
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,340
cloth ties, a finish line.

183
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,469
Not much to a seven-legged

184
00:04:59,466 --> 00:05:02,469
race, hmm.

185
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,140
And of course we can't forget

186
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,140
to take the big family photo.

187
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,349
We always snapped a photo

188
00:05:06,265 --> 00:05:08,349
in front of the barn

189
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,393
at the end of every reunion.

190
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,479
It lets us see how

191
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,479
our family's grown.

192
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,397
Photo in front

193
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:14,397
of the barn, got it.

194
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,024
You sure have

195
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,024
some great memories

196
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,985
of these reunions,

197
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,985
don't you?

198
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,403
Indeedy, and I'm looking

199
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:20,403
forward to making more

200
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,114
at this one.

201
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,616
Oh, I'm sure everypony is,

202
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,616
and I do mean everypony.

203
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,868
We got the whole family

204
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,868
together this time around.

205
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,622
Who knows if they'll all be

206
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,622
able to make the next one?

207
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,499
That's true.

208
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,542
Busy as everypony's lives

209
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:34,542
are getting these days,

210
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,879
chances are pretty slim we'll

211
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:37,879
be this lucky next time around.

212
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,257
Don't worry, Granny,

213
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,257
I'm gonna make sure this

214
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,676
is the most memorable reunion

215
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,676
we've ever had.

216
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,929
I better get started.

217
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,929
I've got some planning to do.

218
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,517
Oh, hootenanny, would you look

219
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:50,517
what your second cousin

220
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,811
is wearing on her head.

221
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,200
Apple Bloom, what are you

222
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:06,200
doing up?

223
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,952
I was gonna ask you

224
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,952
the same thing.

225
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,704
I can't sleep.

226
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,332
My gears are turning in my head

227
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,332
about this reunion.

228
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,793
Yeah, I can't wait

229
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,793
to see my cousin Babs.

230
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,047
We're gonna do

231
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:20,047
so many fun things together.

232
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,549
Fun? That's just

233
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,549
the beginning of it.

234
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,592
Granny Smith handed me

235
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,592
the reins of this reunion,

236
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,678
and I'm gonna make

237
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,678
the most of it.

238
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,930
Apple Bloom, I've got so many

239
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,930
things planned,

240
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,183
you won't even have

241
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,183
a minute's rest.

242
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:35,187
( snoring )

243
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,189
Trust me, little sis.

244
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,940
This reunion

245
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:38,940
I'm putting together

246
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,984
is gonna be

247
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,984
worth the wait.

248
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,819
( snoring )

249
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:52,620
( crowing )

250
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,831
Whoo!

251
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,831
Rise and shine.

252
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,333
We don't have

253
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,333
much time.

254
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:21,733
( burps )

255
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:24,278
Don't forget the glitter.

256
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:25,862
( coughs )

257
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,864
( upbeat theme playing )

258
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,645
Think that'll do it.

259
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:58,645
And just in time too.

260
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,688
They're here.

261
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:02,816
( all cheering )

262
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:11,158
Apple Rose.

263
00:08:11,283 --> 00:08:13,285
Oh.

264
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,579
Ooh, this is more exciting

265
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:16,579
than when it rained frogs.

266
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,345
Howdy, y'all.

267
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,097
And welcome

268
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,097
to the Apple Family Reunion.

269
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:36,183
( all cheering )

270
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,977
My name's Applejack, and I just

271
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,977
wanted to let y'all know

272
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,688
that I got a real big day

273
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,688
planned for you.

274
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,815
We're gonna start off

275
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,815
with an obstacle course

276
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,942
for the young 'uns

277
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,942
and some fritter making

278
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,986
and quilting

279
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,986
for the not-so-young 'uns.

280
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,113
And there's lots more to come

281
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,113
after that.

282
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,739
Hope y'all enjoy it.

283
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,951
Where is she?

284
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,706
Babs.

285
00:08:57,829 --> 00:08:59,706
Coz.

286
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,708
I know it's hasn't

287
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:01,708
been that long

288
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,710
since we've seen

289
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,710
each other but--

290
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,504
It felt like forever.

291
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,504
It felt like forever.

292
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,215
I can't wait to tell

293
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,215
you about my new school.

294
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,217
I can't wait

295
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,217
to hear all about it.

296
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,011
Jeepers, where do I start?

297
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:13,011
Okay, so first day--

298
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,472
Babs. So glad

299
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:15,472
you could come.

300
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,724
What am I, gonna miss out

301
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,724
on spending time

302
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,977
with my favorite cousin?

303
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:20,977
Forget about it.

304
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,271
Why don't you two head over

305
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,271
to the obstacle course?

306
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,524
We kind of want to catch up

307
00:09:23,397 --> 00:09:25,524
a little bit first.

308
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,234
Don't you worry.

309
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,152
There'll be plenty of time

310
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,152
for family bonding

311
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,863
while you're racing against

312
00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,863
your other cousins.

313
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,493
All righty, ponies,

314
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,493
ready to have some fun?

315
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,870
Wow, is that

316
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,870
the finish line?

317
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,747
It's, like, a mile away

318
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,747
or something.

319
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,374
Actually, that's

320
00:09:40,872 --> 00:09:42,374
just the marker

321
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,376
where you go on to

322
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:44,376
the next leg of the race.

323
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,003
There's more?

324
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,003
Much more. Trust me.

325
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,132
I have put together something

326
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,132
you are never gonna forget.

327
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,510
After the seven-legged race,

328
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,510
you're gonna want to hurry up

329
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:57,638
and head over here where you'll

330
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:57,638
be bobbing for apples.

331
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,016
Then you'll run around

332
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:00,016
these trees 50 times

333
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,185
until you're real

334
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,185
good and dizzy.

335
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,938
Then you'll jump

336
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,938
these big wooden hurdles,

337
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:07,065
and then there's the final leg

338
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,276
where you'll balance plates

339
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:09,276
on your head while saying,

340
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,278
"pappy pony picked a pluck

341
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,278
of pickly pluffnuggets"

342
00:10:11,403 --> 00:10:13,405
over and over and over again.

343
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:16,199
The last pony standing wins.

344
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,412
Seriously?

345
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,457
Seriously. Come on, y'all, let's

346
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:23,457
start making some memories.

347
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,667
On your mark,

348
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:26,667
get set, go.

349
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,474
Whoo-whee.

350
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:40,474
Looking good, everypony.

351
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,351
Better go check

352
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:43,351
on the quilt.

353
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:48,482
How long you had those new

354
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:48,482
chompers, Auntie Applesauce?

355
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,568
A lady never reveals

356
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,568
the age of her teeth.

357
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,111
Ugh.

358
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,323
Don't you roll your eyes at me,

359
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:56,323
Miss Apple Rose.

360
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,242
I imagine you two think

361
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:59,242
I have forgotten

362
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,954
what you did to my

363
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,954
parasol six reunions ago.

364
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,459
We were just using it to help

365
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,459
break open that piñata.

366
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,215
Applejack,

367
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,215
delightful to see you.

368
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,717
Are you gonna join us

369
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:16,717
in some quilting?

370
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:18,470
Sorry, Auntie Applesauce,

371
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,846
I am busy,

372
00:11:18,595 --> 00:11:19,846
busy, busy.

373
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,764
Y'all should

374
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,764
get started though.

375
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,518
We couldn't find

376
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,518
our rocking chairs.

377
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,354
I got rid of them

378
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:27,354
to make room for these.

379
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,397
This is the year

380
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,274
y'all are finally

381
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,274
gonna finish that quilt.

382
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,859
Finish it?

383
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,410
Won't that be exciting?

384
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,162
What's that?

385
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,123
I said,

386
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:47,123
won't that be...

387
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:49,125
exciting?

388
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,878
I suppose,

389
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,130
although I have been told

390
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,130
that too much excitement

391
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,425
can wreak havoc on this

392
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,425
youthful complexion of mine.

393
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,135
Oh.

394
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,135
( laughs )

395
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,019
That's the spirit.

396
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:08,019
What did she say?

397
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,689
Huh?

398
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,689
Good gracious.

399
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,940
Golden Delicious--

400
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,151
I think he's racing

401
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,151
with his cousins.

402
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,035
How is Scootaloo

403
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:24,035
and Sweetie Belle?

404
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,079
Great. Oh.

405
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,539
You all right?

406
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,165
So dizzy.

407
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,920
Oh.

408
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,047
Oh.

409
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,687
You've got eight now,

410
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,687
don't you?

411
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,731
Oh sure do.

412
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,731
Tell you what.

413
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,234
My Apple Tart may just be

414
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:56,234
a baby, but he is a hoot.

415
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,195
Having fun?

416
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,195
Sure are.

417
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,573
Better pick up the pace

418
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,573
on these fritters though, huh?

419
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,200
Roll, fold, crimp,

420
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,200
slide to the left.

421
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,202
Roll, fold, crimp,

422
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,202
slide to the left.

423
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,995
Roll, fold, crimp,

424
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,995
slide to the left.

425
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,581
Now you try.

426
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,835
That's it. Gotta keep this

427
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,835
assembly line moving, gals.

428
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,879
We want every Apple here

429
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,879
to get the chance

430
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,507
to taste the best

431
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,507
darn fritters in Equestria.

432
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,842
BOTH:

433
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,842
Pappy pony picked

434
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:21,842
a pluck of pickly pluffnuggets.

435
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,220
Any other blank flanks

436
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:24,220
at your new school?

437
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,514
Yeah, two.

438
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,725
Do they want to be Crusaders?

439
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,725
Totally.

440
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,352
Great. Pappy pony picked a pluck

441
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:31,352
of pickly pluffnuggets.

442
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,064
Pappy pony picked a pluck

443
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:35,064
of pickly pluffnuggets.

444
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,484
I can't feel my tongue.

445
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:39,235
Me, neither.

446
00:13:41,613 --> 00:13:44,240
All right, Apples, break.

447
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,287
( sighs )

448
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:51,289
Finally.

449
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,374
Ooh, can't forget to capture

450
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,374
all these memories

451
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,751
for Granny's album.

452
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,877
Nothing

453
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,877
all that memorable there.

454
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,630
Or there.

455
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,758
Or there.

456
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,802
Come on, Applejack, think.

457
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,012
You gotta kick

458
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,012
this thing up a notch.

459
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,555
Hmm.

460
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,060
I get that my big sis

461
00:14:10,809 --> 00:14:13,060
wants this

462
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,271
to be, like,

463
00:14:13,186 --> 00:14:15,271
a super awesome reunion,

464
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,482
but that was ridiculous.

465
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,651
I thought we'd never get

466
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,651
a minute to just hang out.

467
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,402
APPLEJACK:

468
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,402
And your minute's up.

469
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,155
Your fellow Apples are waiting

470
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,155
for you to join them.

471
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,907
Applejack, I haven't had

472
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,907
any time with Babs.

473
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,827
We were so busy with

474
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,827
that obstacle course

475
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,704
we didn't

476
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,704
even get to talk.

477
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,164
There'll be plenty of time

478
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,164
to bond with Babs

479
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,334
when we do the hayride.

480
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,334
Hayride?

481
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,962
All right, everypony,

482
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,962
step right up, take a seat,

483
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,174
and leave the driving

484
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,174
to these stallions.

485
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,426
Now, I know y'all

486
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:45,426
have been working real hard

487
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,094
making some

488
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,094
awesome memories,

489
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,472
and in all of our past reunions,

490
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,472
we always had

491
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,932
a nice and relaxing hayride

492
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,932
around the farm.

493
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,437
Which is why I decided

494
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,437
to change things up a bit

495
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,733
and try something

496
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,733
just a wee bit more exciting.

497
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,068
So let's get this show

498
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,068
on the road.

499
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,071
Giddyap.

500
00:15:02,193 --> 00:15:05,071
( whinnying )

501
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,323
( upbeat country theme playing )

502
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,991
ALL:

503
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,991
Whoa!

504
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,253
I just had those

505
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:20,253
professionally polished.

506
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,256
Where in the world

507
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:23,256
does that girl have us headed?

508
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:25,007
The west orchard?

509
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:27,761
Yep.

510
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,763
What? I was joking.

511
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,765
Why, we haven't

512
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,765
tended those fields

513
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,267
since all the trees went

514
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,267
and got filled up with--

515
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,735
(Bats chirping)

516
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,656
ALL:

517
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,656
Oh.

518
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,159
Wowsa. I've ever seen

519
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,159
real fruit bats before.

520
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,547
Uh-oh.

521
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,883
( screaming )

522
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,138
( all gasping )

523
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:17,184
Everypony, don't move.

524
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,462
Ruined.

525
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:44,462
Everything is ruined.

526
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,925
Oh, Granny,

527
00:16:44,587 --> 00:16:48,925
I'm so, so sorry.

528
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,302
Oh, it's all right,

529
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,302
child.

530
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,598
But it's not all right.

531
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,598
Just look at this.

532
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,560
The barn, and all my plans

533
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,560
for the perfect family reunion

534
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,604
are completely destroyed.

535
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,731
Maybe that's

536
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,731
good thing.

537
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,317
How can that possibly be

538
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:06,317
a good thing?

539
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,236
GRANNY:

540
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,236
Applejack, you've had us

541
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,236
so caught up

542
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,490
in all the doing, we haven't had

543
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,490
a second to enjoy the company

544
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,701
of the folks

545
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,701
we've been doing it with.

546
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,328
Really?

547
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:17,328
( all murmuring agreement )

548
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,874
Oh, Granny Smith,

549
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,874
here, you let me be in charge

550
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,834
of creating great memories,

551
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,961
and the only thing anypony's

552
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,961
gonna remember

553
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,838
about this reunion

554
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,966
is that it was the worst one

555
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:29,966
we ever had.

556
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,888
Hey, now, everypony's

557
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:34,888
still here, ain't they?

558
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,265
Still plenty of time

559
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,265
to make good memories.

560
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,853
You just gotta give everypony

561
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:41,853
a chance to actually make them.

562
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:45,899
The family photo.

563
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,860
Guess we can't take it

564
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,860
in front of the barn this year.

565
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,153
Unless...

566
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,114
Everypony,

567
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,114
I have one more activity.

568
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,492
Applejack.

569
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,746
Trust me, Granny Smith,

570
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,746
this'll be one we'll remember

571
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:01,497
for all the right reasons.

572
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,505
Whoo-hoo.
