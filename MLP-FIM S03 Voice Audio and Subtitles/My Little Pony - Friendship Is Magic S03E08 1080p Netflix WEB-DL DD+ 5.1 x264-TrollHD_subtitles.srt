112
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,712

for him to look good.

114
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,923

115
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:34,923

119
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,639
trouble,

120
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,892

00:03:45,017 --> 00:03:46,518
Uh...

123
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,145
We already agreed

124
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,897
on the whole jewel thing

125
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,897

135
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,624

some watching.

137
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,837
All I'm saying

138
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,837
is if Fluttershy thought

139
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,131
that her beloved little friend

140
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,131
shouldn't be left alone

00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,841
while you're busy

142
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:17,841
in the Crystal Empire,

143
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,427
then maybe that's just

144
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,427

158
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,505
All right, you can watch him.

159
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,507
But only because, uh...

160
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,509
Tank's got a strict

161
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:01,509
flying regimen

162
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,053
and someone needs

163
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,053
to make sure

164
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,513
that he doesn't slack off

165
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,513

166

167
00:05:07,141 --> 00:05:08,433
Oh.

168
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,522
You know, the two of us

169
00:05:11,228 --> 00:05:14,522
are very diligent.

170
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:16,233
Okay, whatever.

171
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,526
Yes, yes. And more importantly,

172
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:18,526
as for Opal,

173
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,403
she likes to eat every

174
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,403
36 and a half minutes.

175
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,405
You groom her with

176
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,405
her silken brush, head to toe.

177
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,491
And don't forget to pooch

178
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,491
her pillow out in the middle,

179
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:25,742
that's where she likes it.

180
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,035
And the temperature

181
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,035
in the room

182
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,663
should always be exactly

183
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,663
81.4 degrees.

184
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,915
That's the only way

185
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:31,915
she can get to sleep

186
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,668
And, um--

187
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,668
Hmm, oh, good.

188
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:38,505
So thanks for your help

189
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:38,505
and good luck to you.

190
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,465
( clears throat )

191
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,801
I think the dragon

192
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,801
was expecting

193
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,220
a little something

194
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,220
for his efforts.

195
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,561
Almost as beautiful

196
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:53,561
as the pony who gave it to me.

197
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,105
Shouldn't you be

198
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,105
critter-proofing

199
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,065
the library or something?

200
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,065
Tank has a tendency to--

201
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,441
( crashing, Opal screeching )

202
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,486
( objects crashing )

203
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,779
Critter-proofing.

204
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,990
Yeah,

205
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,990
I'll get right on that.

206
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,241
( chuckles )

207
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,451
Three down, three to go.

208
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:09,786
What's that you said, Gummy?

209
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,166
Uh-huh. Well, you're just

210
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,166
gonna have to ask Pinkie Pie

211
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:15,458
about that one.

212
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,668
Ask me! Ask me!

213
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,461
Go ahead, ask her.

214
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,925
Of course,

215
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,925
you can have another cupcake!

216
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:30,265
Hmm. Mm-hm, yeah.

217
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,641
Why didn't you say so?

218
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,478
I'll get you a bigger pond

219
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,478
immediately.

220
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,357
I think what Gummy's

221
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,357
trying to say is--

222
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,150
He's always wanted a pair

223
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,150
of riding pants?

224
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,069
His toenails need

225
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,069
a new coat of shellack?

226
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,987
He wants to floss twice a day

227
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,987
instead of just once?

228
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,113
( laughing )

229
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,990
I think what Gummy

230
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,990
is trying to say

231
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,159
is that he'd like

232
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,159
a little Spike time.

233
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,620
Who wouldn't?

234
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:52,620
Spike time is the best.

235
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:56,666
Alas, it doesn't come cheap.

236
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,335
All I'm saying

237
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,295
is that you might wanna think

238
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,295
about a helmet.

239
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,755
You only wanna get hit

240
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,755
in the head

241
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:04,883
by a flying turtle once.

242
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:10,138
A thousand plus carats

243
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:10,138
of pure deliciousness.

244
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,727
Looks like you got a regular

245
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,727
pet day care in here, Spike.

246
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,645
You'll still be able to get

247
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,645
some good playtime

248
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,564
with Winona like you said,

249
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:19,564
though, won't you?

250
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,982
She tends

251
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,982
to get a little wild

252
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,401
if she doesn't get

253
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,401
her exercise.

254
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:23,651
Exercise, sure, of course.

255
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,779
( Winona barks )

256
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,779
SPIKE: Whoa!

257
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,156
I don't remember seeing

258
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,156
critters on the invite list.

259
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,325
That's because we're leaving

260
00:07:28,282 --> 00:07:30,325
them here with Spike.

261
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,619
He's gonna do a little

262
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,619
critter sitting for us.

263
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:34,079
Oh, really?

264
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,377
So sorry I'm late.

265
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,879
Silly bunny

266
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,879
had hidden his brush.

267
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,547
Be sure you get plenty

268
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,547
on his tail

269
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,549
or it won't get as poofy

270
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,549
as he likes it.

271
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,761
Come on, girls,

272
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,761
or we're gonna miss the train.

273
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,388
One more for the road.

274
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,973
Oh, you little puppy,

275
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:52,973
come on here.

276
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,809
No. No, no, no.

277
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,809
I love you more.

278
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:57,560
No, I love you more.

279
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,147
I love you more!

280
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,319
Oh, I promise

281
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,319
it will be okay.

282
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,570
I'll fluff your tail

283
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,570
twice next week.

284
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:08,822
Hmph!

285
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,240
Three times?

286
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,950
( squeaks )

287
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,454
Oh, I know, it's a chilly

288
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:15,454
81.2 in here.

289
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,747
Spike, take care of this,

290
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,747
would you please?

291
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:18,999
You got it.

292
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,875
So, what're you thinking

293
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,086
about that hooting

294
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:23,086
little friend of yours?

295
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,172
Suppose you'll want me

296
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,172
to keep an eye on him too.

297
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,840
That would be nice.

298
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,050
You sure you don't already

299
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,050
have your hands full?

300
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,845
Ah, pshaw. I'll be fine.

301
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,597
But, uh,

302
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,597
just between you and me,

303
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,143
I've gotta give priority

304
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:38,143
to the paying customers.

305
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,602
( sighs )

306
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,358
You're absolutely sure

307
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,358
you can do this?

308
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,734
Of course. Wouldn't have

309
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,734
agreed to it if I couldn't.

310
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,863
Piece of cake. Speaking of cake,

311
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,863
I've got a little something

312
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,614
I need to attend to.

313
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,742
Yeah, like, keeping an eye

314
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:54,742
on a house full of critters.

315
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,411
( slurps )

316
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,997
Uh, yeah. That was totally

317
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,997
what I was talking about.

318
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,376
Relax. Go to your welcoming

319
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:02,376
thing in the Crystal Empire.

320
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,336
Spike's got it all

321
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:04,336
under control.

322
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,009
( crashing and thudding )

323
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:13,928
( Winona barking )

324
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,436
( propellers whirring )

325
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,436
( Opal meowing )

326
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,646
( barking )

327
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:28,818
( glass breaking )

328
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,660
( crashing )

329
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,872
All right, sidekicks!

330
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,872
Front and center!

331
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,123
( barks )

332
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,750
There are six of you,

333
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,003
but there's only one

334
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,003
right here in front of me.

335
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,465
Two. And what I say goes.

336
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,883
( hoots )

337
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,927
Spike, the boss of you,

338
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,927
that's who.

339
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,430
One, two, three.

340
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,516
Come on, number four.

341
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,518
( mewling )

342
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,437
( panting )

343
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,190
One, two, three,

344
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,190
four, five.

345
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:08,442
( grunts )

346
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:10,235
Who's missing?

347
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,072
Angel.

348
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,869
All I wanted

349
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,869
were some jewels.

350
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,621
Big, juicy delicious jewels.

351
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:22,872
And now what do I have?

352
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,624
A missing rabbit and--

353
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,709
( Winona barking )

354
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,256
SWEETIE BELLE:

355
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,256
Oh, little fluffy

356
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,256
Angel Bunnykins,

357
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,091
you're so cute.

358
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,136
The natural waves in his fluff

359
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:36,136
are to die for.

360
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:38,513
( Spike clears throat )

361
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,601
Isn't Angel

362
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:42,601
just the cutest thing

363
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,936
you've ever seen?

364
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,936
( blows raspberry )

365
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,318
Look, you don't wanna

366
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,318
be with me.

367
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,445
I'd rather not chase you around

368
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,445
all over the place

369
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,280
when I could be enjoying

370
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,280
some jewel cake.

371
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,699
Watch me solve

372
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,699
both our problems.

373
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,744
You know, I'm supposed to be

374
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,744
watching him,

375
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,538
but you all have just

376
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,538
hit it off so well,

377
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,039
that maybe--

378
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,960
Maybe I could let you

379
00:11:05,165 --> 00:11:08,960
take care of him instead.

380
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,545
We would, but we've got

381
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,465
some major Crusaders business

382
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:13,465
planned for today.

383
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,802
Major. We're getting our

384
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:17,802
skydiving Cutie Marks today.

385
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,304
ALL:

386
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,304
Yeah.

387
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,349
Well, I suppose

388
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:22,349
if you've got other plans.

389
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,351
It's just--

390
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,351
You're so good with him.

391
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,270
Like "get a Cutie Mark

392
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:27,270
for bunny-sitting" good.

393
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,939
A bunny-sitting Cutie Mark.

394
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:33,193
That would be adorable.

395
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,944
He does seem to like us.

396
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,904
And we hadn't exactly

397
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,904
figured out

398
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,866
how we're going to pull off

399
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,866
this whole skydiving thing.

400
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,202
You know what?

401
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:42,202
As hard as it's gonna be

402
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,454
for me to part

403
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:44,454
with these little guys,

404
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,374
I think you should probably

405
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,374
just take all of them.

406
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:48,791
If you ask me,

407
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,585
the more critters

408
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,585
you take care of,

409
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,086
the more chances you have

410
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,086
of getting

411
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,589
some kind of critter-sitting

412
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:54,589
Cutie Mark.

413
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:55,840
Am I right?

414
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:57,800
Or am I right?

415
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:00,803
Sure.

416
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,347
Yes.

417
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:02,347
But wait.

418
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,848
How are we gonna take good

419
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:03,848
care of them

420
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,559
without treats

421
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,559
for when they're good?

422
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,268
And we'll need beds

423
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,268
for when their tired.

424
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,270
And toys.

425
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:09,270
They need toys.

426
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,938
It's an afternoon.

427
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,233
They don't need all that stuff.

428
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,233
They'll be fine.

429
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,443
We need to be able

430
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:15,443
to buy them some things.

431
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,238
One jewel might be able

432
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:18,238
to cover it all.

433
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,575
Uh, what would I possibly

434
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:21,575
be doing with jewels?

435
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,660
I happen to know for a fact

436
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,621
that Applejack gave you a gem

437
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,621
to watch Winona.

438
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,623
Which means...

439
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,543
Obviously no one around here

440
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:31,543
is getting a Cutie Mark

441
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,046
for kindness towards a poor,

442
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:35,046
hungry little dragon.

443
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,297
Take it or leave it.

444
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,299
We'll take it.

445
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,264
♪ Gonna put in some flour

446
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,264
And add a little sugar ♪

447
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,267
♪ For my five

448

Delicious jewels ♪

449

SWEETIE BELLE:

450
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,477
But pink feathers

451
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:49,477
would look so good

452
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,854
with your eyes.

453
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,357
Nah, that bird could use

454
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,357
a little color.

455
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,944
SCOOTALOO:

456
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,944
Has anyone seen Tank's head?

457
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:57,944
Where's his head?

458
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,987
What've you done

459
00:12:58,069 --> 00:12:59,987
to the turtle?

460
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,618
Oh, he totally forgot

461
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,618
he could do that.

462
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,747
APPLE BLOOM:

463
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,747
Yeah. So pretty sure

464
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,665
critter-sitting

465
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,665
Cutie Marks are out.

466
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,126
And our critter-grooming

467
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,126
Cutie Marks

468
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,878
probably aren't going to appear

469
00:13:13,251 --> 00:13:15,878
any time soon either.

470
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,756
( hooting )

471
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,756
( Spike sighs )

472
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,674
All right,

473
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,674
load them up.

474
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,760
And you can give me back

475
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:21,760
that jewel I gave you.

476
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,304
Sorry.

477
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,304
We don't have it anymore.

478
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:25,639
What? Why not?

479
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:26,931
How do you think we paid

480
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,268
for the industrial-sized

481
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,268
pet hair dryer?

482
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,605
( hair dryer whirring )

483
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,732
Oh.

484
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,610
( Winona barking )

485
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,737
( Opal mewling )

486
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:47,160
( laughing )

487
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,206
ZECORA:

488
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,206
Zecora knows just what to do

489
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,376
about all this bad mojo

490
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,376
that's floating around you.

491
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,670
I'm thinking a cage

492
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,255
and a great big lock

493
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:59,255
might be next.

494
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,801
Zecora can take the bad away

495
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,801
if you do just what I say.

496
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,051
Really?

497
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,679
ZECORA:

498
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,679
But before I can do my duty,

499
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,556
I'm going to need

500
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:08,556
some of your booty.

501
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,725
( grunting )

502
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,730
Where are you going?

503
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,816
You think jewels

504
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,816
are what you need,

505
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,110
but there's no worse mojo

506
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,110
than dragon greed.

507
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,119
( laughing )

508
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,413
( stomach growling )

509
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,708
(<i> wistful theme playing</i> )

510
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,586
( grunts )

511
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,384
Almost there.

512
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,805
Mm-hm.

513
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,266
Just taking good care

514
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,266
of everyone's animals.

515
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:58,314
What am I gonna have to do

516
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:58,314
to get this to go away?

517
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,360
( sighs )

518
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,863
Then this is just

519
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,863
between you and me, right?

520
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,657
No other pony

521
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,657
has to hear a word about it?

522
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,283
( Opal mewling )

523
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,283
( Winona barking )

524
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:13,287
A word about what now?

525
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,711
This better be important.

526
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,798
CONDUCTOR:

527
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,798
All aboard.

528
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,008
Angel.

529
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,096
I can't have all of these

530
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:30,096
animals on my train.

531
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,557
Not without tickets

532
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,557
and not without chaperones.

533
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,601
All I need is to get

534
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,601
on for one minute,

535
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,686
grab a bunny and get off.

536
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:36,686
Promise.

537
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,396
( chuckling ):

538
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:38,396
A likely story.

539
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:41,691
No chaperone, no train.

540
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:44,402
( ponies laughing )

541
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,070
SWEETIE BELLE:

542
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,070
Skydiving Cutie Marks.

543
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,031
( all laughing )

544
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,617
Is three ponies enough?

545
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,621
( groans )

546
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,623
At least

547
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,623
I have you two left,

548
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,041
my delectable

549
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,041
little treasures.

550
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,837
CONDUCTOR:

551
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,837
All aboard

552
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,837
for the Crystal Empire.

553
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,256
ALL:

554
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,256
Crystal Empire?

555
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,717
I've always wanted to see

556
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,717
the Crystal Empire.

557
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,218
I wish I were dressed

558
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,218
for it,

559
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,638
but still

560
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:11,638
The Crystal Empire.

561
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,055
We're not really going.

562
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,307
We just needed

563
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,307
to get on the train

564
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:15,642
so I can get that rabbit.

565
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,602
And when I do, we're off.

566
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,521
What?

567
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,521
It's not fair.

568
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,773
( blows raspberry )

569
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,357
There he is!

570
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,862
CONDUCTOR:

571
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,862
Next stop, the Crystal Empire.

572
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,615
No, no, no, no, no.

573
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,747
APPLE BLOOM:

574
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,747
So it seems the Crystal Empire

575
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,500
would be really cold,

576
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,500
but I've heard that it's not.

577
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,251
It's as warm as can be.

578
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,878
Do you think

579
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,878
the walls are crystal?

580
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,630
Ah. Maybe even see-through?

581
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,466
SCOOTALOO:

582
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,466
Can you imagine?

583
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:48,466
See-through walls.

584
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,719
( all gasp )

585
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,179
( crashing )

586
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:55,723
( Opal mewling )

587
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,982
Take it. Just take it.

588
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:08,110
( train engine chugging )

589
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,822
It's so beautiful.

590
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,114
Well, enjoy it

591
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,114
while you can.

592
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,366
We're not getting

593
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,366
out of this car

594
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,659
until we're back

595
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:14,659
in Ponyville.

596
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:17,119
There is no way, no how,

597
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,122
we're coming all the way

598
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:20,122
to the Crystal Empire

599
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,582
without looking around.

600
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,126
No pony's gonna get past

601
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,126
this dragon.

602
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,881
Don't make me use this.

603
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,799
You wouldn't dare.

604
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,426
( laughing )

605
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,605
Oh no.

606
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,363
( gasps )

607
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,952
Whoa. Just whoa.

608
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,996
Ah! I'm in crystal heaven!

609
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,749
Shh. Quiet there.

610
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:07,712
There's the bunny.

611
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,464
Please, please. Pretty please,

612
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,464
don't go down there.

613
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,637
I'll fluff your tail.

614
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,849
I'll perm, highlight

615
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,849
and blow it out

616
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,060
if you'll just stop.

617
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,271
What do you want?

618
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:25,271
Name it, and it's yours.

619
00:18:25,396 --> 00:18:26,981
( Spike panting )

620
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:31,027
( groans )

621
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,570
Mwah.

622
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,238
( all gasp )

623
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,199
( shrieking )

624
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:39,994
Oh, my goodness.

625
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,622
CONDUCTOR:

626
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,622
All aboard.

627
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,500
Now you're coming with me.

628
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,500
( whimpering )

629
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,212
We made it.

630
00:18:50,296 --> 00:18:51,881
Without seeing the palace.

631
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,841
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:

632
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,841
I think this car's empty.

633
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,762
They're coming this way.

634
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:57,762
Everybody down.

635
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,808
There has got to be

636
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,808
a better solution.

637
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:02,976
Shh.

638
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,727
Oh. Don't sit down,

639
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:04,727
don't sit down.

640
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,606
APPLEJACK:

641
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:08,606
Whoo-wee, my dogs are barking.

642
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:09,816
( Winona barks )

643
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,610
Did y'all hear that?

644
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,610
They really are.

645
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,530
RAINBOW DASH:

646
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,530
Huh, bummer, Spike got

647
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,530
to miss out on all this.

648
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,491
He would have had fun here.

649
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,660
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:

650
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,660
I'm sure he's having

651
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,660
a great time

652
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,536
watching all the critters

653
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,536
back at home.

654
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,247
APPLEJACK:

655
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,247
Think he's still got a handle

656
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,247
on things?

657
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,500
If he is staying calm

658
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,500
and collected,

659
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,087
I bet he is doing

660
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,087
a terrific job as a leader.

661
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,799
Go ahead, bunny.

662
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,799
Do your worst.

663
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:36,968
I deserve it.

664
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,262
I ignored you,

665
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,556
tried to pawn you off

666
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:42,556
on someone else.

667
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,433
I didn't take these

668
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,433
silly things out

669
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,686
or fluff this

670
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:46,686
like I was supposed to.

671
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,313
I wasn't really thinking

672
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:49,313
about you at all.

673
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,274
Any of you.

674
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,274
Just wanted the jewels.

675
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,821
I hope you'll all forgive me

676
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,821
someday.

677
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,823
You will?

678
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,283
( stomach growling )

679
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,576
Oh, great.

680
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,164
I'm gonna be the one

681
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:06,164
who gives us away.

682
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,130
Where did you--?

683
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,465
( stomach growling )

684
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,465
APPLEJACK: You all hear that?

685
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,178
( growling stops )

686
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,973
( engine chugging )

687
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,688
APPLEJACK:

688
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,688
I can't wait to scratch

689
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:30,688
the belly on Winona.

690
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,272
Oh, I miss her.

691
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,566
I can't wait

692
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,566
to see Owlowicious.

693
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:34,817
( ponies laughs )

694
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,194
SPIKE:

695
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,194
Hello.

696
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,613
Thought we'd meet you

697
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:39,613
at the station.

698
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,116
SWEETIE BELLE:

699
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,116
So we could hear all about

700
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,116
the Crystal Empire

701
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,326
and find out if you brought us

702
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:44,326
one of the Crystal snow globes

703
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,953
that they sell

704
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,953
at the train station.

705
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,164
How did you know

706
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,164
about the snow globes?

707
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,289
Um...

708
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,377
Lucky guess?

709
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,129
I've gotta hand it to you,

710
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,129
Spike.

711
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,842
You did a really good job

712
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,842
of taking care of the animals.

713
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,929
Oh, Spike,

714
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,929
Angel looks perfect.

715
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,681
You did such a good job

716
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:05,681
fluffing his tail.

717
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,350
Yeah, well,

718
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,350
we're like this now.

719
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,143
( hooting )

720
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,562
You know who.

721
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,985
So, what are you thinking?

722
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,985
Bake them into a jewel pie.

723
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,614
Ooh. Six-layer gem cake

724
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:21,614
sounds pretty good.

725
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,365
Yeah, it does.

726
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,534
It really, really does.

727
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:31,082
