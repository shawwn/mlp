00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,279
That doesn't make any sense,

198
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,279
it doesn't even rhyme.

199
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,157
TWILIGHT ( narrating ):

200
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,157
I cast the spell so I could

201
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,157
find out what it was.

202
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,784
but nothing

203
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:25,784
seemed to happen.

204
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,162
But now I know

205
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,162
something did happen.

206
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,747
The spell has changed

207
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,747
the Elements of Harmony.

208
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,249
That must be

209
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,249
why their Cutie Marks

210
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,875
are all wrong.

211
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,503
So just cast a counterspell

212
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,503
to switch them back.

213
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,255
There is no counterspell.

214
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,257
Why don't you just use

215
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,257
that memory spell you used

216
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,009
to fix everypony

217
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,009
when Discord was here?

218
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,885
It's not their memories,

219
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,885
Spike.

220
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,138
It's their true selves

221
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,138
that have been altered.

222
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,140
Zecora's cure

223
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,140
for the Cutie Pox?

224
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,018
That won't work either.

225
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,394
Well,

226
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,394
maybe it won't be so bad.

227
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,438
Maybe our friends will grow

228
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,438
to like their new lives.

229
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,024
No, Spike.

230
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,900
They're not who they

231
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:58,900
are meant to be anymore.

232
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,402
Their destinies

233
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:01,402
are now changed,

234
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,280
and it's all my fault.

Aw, come on, Twilight.

256
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,187
You'll figure out a way

257
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,187
to fix this.

258
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:19,480

You're right, Spike.

260
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,241
And they mean more to me

261
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,241
than anything.

262
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,492
My friends.

00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,372
Twilight? Are you all right?

265
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:38,250
I've got it.

266
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,252
I know what to do.

267
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,252
You do?

268
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,004
I may not be able to remind them

269
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:43,004
of who they are,

270
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,757
but I can show them

271
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,757
what they mean to each other.

272
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,135
They'll find the part

273
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,135
of themselves that's been lost

274
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,762
so they can help the friend

275
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,762
they care about so much.

276
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,014
Come on, Spike.

277
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,145
TWILIGHT:

278
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,145
Fluttershy, wait.

279
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:01,148
Oh, hey, Twilight.

280
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:02,399
Where are you going?

281
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,401
I'm moving back

282
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,401
to Cloudsdale.

283
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,902
I don't know what's wrong,

284
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,529
but I can't seem

285
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,529
to make any pony laugh.

286
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,781
( squishing )

287
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,785
Before you go,

288
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:13,785
I was wondering

289
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,870
if you might be willing

290
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,870
to help Rainbow Dash.

291
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,248
She's really struggling

292
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,248
with her animals.

293
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:22,877
But I don't really know

294
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:22,877
anything about animals.

295
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,380
But you do know something

296
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,380
about Rainbow Dash.

297
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,884
I know

298
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,884
that she's a true friend.

299
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,513
And I'll do anything

300
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,513
I can to help her.

301
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,642
RAINBOW DASH:

302
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,642
Help!

303
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,768
Rainbow Dash!

304
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,145
RAINBOW DASH:

305
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:40,145
I'm in here! Help!

306
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:42,272
I'm trapped!

307
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,773
Hurry, Twilight.

308
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,900
Can't you do some sort of spell

309
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:45,900
to get her out?

310
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,402
No.

311
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,654
Fluttershy, you're the only one

312
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,654
who can help.

313
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,157
Rainbow Dash needs you.

314
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:57,537
Um, hello?

315
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,789
Little woodland creatures?

316
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:03,543
( growling and squealing )

317
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,295
I know

318
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,295
that you're all very upset

319
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,672
and feel like giving

320
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,672
Rainbow Dash a hard time,

321
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,757
but we'd all

322
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,757
really appreciate it

323
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,136
if you'd calm down

324
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:13,136
and maybe rest for a bit?

325
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,516
Oh, uh, look.

326
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,894
Here's some nice juicy leaves

327
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,894
for you to munch on,

328
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,939
and some crunchy,

329
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:24,939
munchy acorns too.

330
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,400
Wouldn't you like

331
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,400
to take a break

332
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,277
and have a little snack?

333
00:09:29,403 --> 00:09:31,279
( squeaks )

334

335
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:32,780
Aw, look at that,

336
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,282
I guess you were all

337
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,282
just cranky

338
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,909
because you were hungry.

339
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,789
Oh, you are very welcome,

340
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:41,789
little friends.

341
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,166
Mm.

342
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,920
Goodness. It's like

343
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,920
I can understand them.

344
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,422
I feel strange,

345
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,673
like this is

346
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,673
what I'm meant to do.

347
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,300

Fluttershy, look!

352
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:06,147
Your Cutie Mark.

353
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,027
It worked. It worked!

354
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,654
Oh, I'm so happy

355
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,654
you're back to normal.

00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,208
( upbeat theme playing )

584
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,588
But what do I do now?

585
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,465
Is there a book about being

586
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,465
a princess I should read?

587
00:18:11,591 --> 00:18:12,717
(chuckles)

588
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,469
There will be time

589
00:18:12,842 --> 00:18:15,469
for all of that later.

590
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:24,896
We are gathered here today

591
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,066
in celebration

592
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,066
of a momentous occasion.

593
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,402
My most faithful student,

594
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,402
Twilight Sparkle,

595
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,529
has done many

596
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,529
extraordinary things

597
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,281
since she's lived

598
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,281
in Ponyville.

599
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:40,286
She even helped reunite me

600
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:40,286
with my sister, Princess Luna.

601
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:44,916
But today, Twilight Sparkle

602
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:44,916
did something extraordinary.

603
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,045
She created new magic,

604
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,045
proving without a doubt

605
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,047
that she is ready

606
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,047
to be crowned

607
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,050
Equestria's newest princess.

608
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,052
Fillies and gentlecolts,

609
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,680
may I present

610
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,680

611
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,433

Say something, princess.

629
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:43,808
Oh, um...

630
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:45,935
Ahem. A little while ago,

631
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,187
my teacher and mentor,

632
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,187
Princess Celestia,

633
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,606
sent me to live

634
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,606
in Ponyville.

635
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,942
She sent me

636
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,942
to study friendship,

637
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,068
which is something

638
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,195
I didn't really care

639
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,195
much about.

640
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,949
But now, on a day like today,

641
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,949
I can honestly say

642
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,076
I wouldn't be standing here

643
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,703
if it weren't

644
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,703
for the friendships

645
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,454
I've made with all of you.

646
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,915
Each one of you taught me

647
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,915
something about friendship,

648
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,669
and for that

649
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,669
I will always be grateful.

650
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:16,298
Today, I consider myself

651
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:16,298
the luckiest pony in Equestria.

652
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,677
Thank you, friends.

653
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,677

656
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,936
I'm so proud of you.

657
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,438
Are you crying?

658
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:32,857
Of course not.

659
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,443
It's liquid pride,

660
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,443
a totally different thing.

662
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,948
Way to go, princess.

663
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:43,576
Best coronation day ever!
