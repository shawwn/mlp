Six, seven, eight, nine,

00:00:04,797 --> 00:00:06,799
10, 11, 12.

4
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,717
Hm,

5
00:00:06,924 --> 00:00:08,717
that's not that many.

6
00:00:08,843 --> 00:00:10,302
Are you kidding?

7
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,221
How are you supposed

8
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:13,221
to read 12 books in one weekend?

9
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,182
Princess Celestia obviously

10
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,182
thinks I can

11
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,184
or she would never have assigned

12
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,184
them to me.

13
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,019
I'm not planning

14
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:19,019
on letting her down.

15
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,105
Well, I hope you're not planning

16
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:22,105
on sleeping, then, either.

17
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,775
Actually, Spike, why don't you

18
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,775
take the day off?

19
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,527
Really?

20
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,527
Why not?

21
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,737
These books are gonna

22
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,737
keep me busy for a while.

23
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:33,116
Hm, I do have a long list

24
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:33,116
of things I've been dying to do.

25
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,621
"Touch nose with tongue."

26
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,040
Done.

27
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,500
"Play bongos on my belly."

28
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,294
Done.

29
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,713
"Smell my dirty feet."

[SNIFFING]

31
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,383
Done!

32
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,347
Huh. That didn't take nearly

33
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,347

( cat screeches )

58

Oh, no. Wait.

Runaway balloon!

00:01:54,865 --> 00:01:57,826
Sorry!

Whew.

00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,602

in the middle of the dark

67
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,693
and scary Everfree forest.

What was that?

70
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,532
Come on, Spike.

71
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,577
Just because this forest is full

72
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,577
of wild, dangerous animals

73
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,579
doesn't mean

74
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:42,579
that you're gonna see one.

Come and get me,

83
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,607
you big goons.

84
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:13,443
Run.

85
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,946
I'm running.

86
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,946
I'm running.

SPIKE: Wow, Applejack.

90
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:43,140
That was amazing.

91
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,684
You rocketed those boulders

92
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:45,684
at them like they were rockets.

93
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,310
Pow! Pow! Pow!

94
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,855
You saved my life.

95
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,316
You saved my life.

96
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,486
Aw, don't mention it,

97
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:56,486
Spike.

98
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,488
Come on, we should be heading

99
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,488
on back now.

100
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,824
Man, am I lucky you were

101
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,824
out here.

102
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,450
Uh, why were you

103
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,450
out here?

104
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,494
Saw the balloon floating

105
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,494
by with no pony in it

106
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,038
and I came out here

107
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,038
to investigate.

108
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:07,873
Guess you did too, huh?

109
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,000
Uh, yeah.

110
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,670
I was investigating

111
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,670
the runaway hot air balloon too.

112
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,215
So now that that mystery's

113
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,215
been solved,

114
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,008
let's get out here, huh?

115
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,807
Thanks for walking me home,

116
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:25,807
Spike.

117
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,434
That was mighty kind

118
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,434
of you,

119
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,061
but now I have some chores

120
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,061
that need tending to,

121
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,520
so see you later.

122
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,606
What chores?

123
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,606
I'll do them.

124
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,066
That's sweet,

125
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,066
but you don't have--

126
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,567
It's the least I can do.

127
00:04:34,191 --> 00:04:35,567
You saved my life.

128
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,360
I need to repay

129
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,360
the favor.

130
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,030
Shoot, Spike, that's what

131
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,030
friends do for each other.

132
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,615
You don't need

133
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:41,615
to repay the favor.

134
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,700
Yes, I do.

135
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,700
Sugar, it's okay.

136
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,160
It's not necessary.

137
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,828
Applejack,

138
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,828
you don't understand.

139
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,914
This is something

140
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,914
that I really need to do.

141
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,168
I hate to get in the way of you

142
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,168
doing something you need to.

143
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,920
Great.

144
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,920
What should I do?

145
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,838
Uh...Apple Bloom's over yonder,

146
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,548
giving little Piggington

147
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,548
a bath.

148
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,800
I was gonna lend her

149
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,800
a hoof,

150
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,136
but maybe you could lend her

151
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,136
one instead.

152
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,721
On the double.

153
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,265
Applejack said

154
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,265
I could help you.

155
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,599
Great.

156
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,434
I could use all

157
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:09,434
the help I can get.

158
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,400
Wait till Applejack sees

159
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,400
how you sparkle.

160
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,822
Ta-da.

161
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,323
Good job, you two.

162
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,867
Applejack,

163
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,867
is it okay if I get going?

164
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,995
I don't wanna be late

165
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,995
for my Crusaders meeting.

166
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,164
We're getting fitted

167
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,164
for water skis.

168
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,541
Ha. You definitely don't want

169
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:33,541
to be late for that.

170
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,295
Water-skiing Cutie Mark,

171
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:36,295
here I come.

172
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,963
Spike,

173
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:37,963
you can head on out too.

174
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,881
I reckon you have re-paid me

175
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:39,881
in full

176
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,092
so we are officially

177
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,092
even-Steven.

178
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:43,802
What? Oh, no.

179
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,762
We aren't even close

180
00:05:43,927 --> 00:05:45,762
to being even-Steven.

181
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,515
Please, Applejack, you must

182
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,515
allow me to assist you further.

183
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,433
I don't know, Spike.

184
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,433
Just don't feel right

185
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,602
to have you doing things

186
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,602
for me.

187
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,395
Please.

188
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,395
Really, you don't--

189
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,482
Pretty please.

190
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,482
It's just not necessary--

191
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,069
Pretty, pretty,

192
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:01,069
pretty please.

193
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:02,612
Oh, all right.

194
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,698
You can help Granny Smith

195
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,698
and me bake some...

196
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,325
Pies. Pies.

197
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,620
I'm helping Applejack make

198
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,620
some pies.

199
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,206
Spike,

200
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,206
little feller,

201
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,666
could you get us

202
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,666
some more eggs?

203
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,168
SPIKE:

204
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,168
Coming right up.

205
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:22,966
( crash )

206
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,718
SPIKE:

207
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:24,718
Ah, oops.

208
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,094
Sorry, Applejack.

209
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,555
Let me get something

210
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,555
to clean that up.

211
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,820
Appreciate all your help today,

212
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,820
sugar cube,

213
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,989
but I can take it

214
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,989
from here.

215
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,324
Don't be ridiculous.

216
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,950
It is my honor

217
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:48,950
and my duty.

218
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,369
Today is just

219
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:50,369
the beginning.

220
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,705
What's that now?

221
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:53,705
You saved my life.

222
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,083
According to the

223
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,083
"Spike the Dragon Code,"

224
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,585
I owe you a life debt

225
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,585
and must serve you.

226
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,628
Now,

227
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,628
what about Twilight?

228
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,507
Doesn't she need your help

229
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:04,507
and such?

230
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,926
Huh. You're right.

231
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,677
I better break the news

232
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,677
to Twilight.

233
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,971
I just hope she doesn't take

234
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,971
it too hard.

235
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,431
Be right back.

236
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,399
Come on, Spike.

237
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,901
This is your personal moral,

238
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,901
ethical Dragon Code

239
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,695
we're talking about.

240
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:25,695
You have to do this.

241
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,365
It's not like you and Twilight

242
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,365
won't be friends anymore.

243
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,658
But it won't be the same.

244
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,412
But it has to be done.

245
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,206
Twilight, Applejack

246
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:36,206
just saved my life

247
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,792
from horrible,

248
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:38,792
dragon-eating timber wolves.

249
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,585
Mm-hm...

250
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,838
And, as you are aware,

251
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,838
I adhere to my Dragon Code

252
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,465
and this means

253
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:45,465
I must serve her

254
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,009
for the rest

255
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,009
of my natural-born days.

256
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,552
I'm sure you understand.

257
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:52,139
Mm-hm...

258
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:56,893
It's been an honor being

259
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:56,893
your faithful assistant.

260
00:07:57,018 --> 00:07:58,519
Sounds good.

261
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,649
( sighs )

262
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:07,654
She said it was okay.

263
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,905
Really?

264
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:08,905
Really?

265
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,615
So with Twilight's blessing,

266
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,869
I am free to follow my code

267
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,869
and serve you until...

268
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:18,373
Well, until forever.

269
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:31,428
Listen, sugar cube, I completely

270
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:31,428
respect your Dragon Code,

271
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,430
truly I do,

272
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,430
but I just can't cotton

273
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,016
with you permanently serving me.

274
00:08:36,141 --> 00:08:37,267
Please, Applejack.

275
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,060
My Dragon Code is a part

276
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,060
of me.

277
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,188
I have to be true to myself.

278
00:08:41,313 --> 00:08:42,814
If you don't let me do this,

279
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,399
I won't be

280
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,399
a noble dragon anymore.

281
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,777
Oh. Well,

282
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:47,777
I can't have you feeling

283
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,364
like you're not a noble dragon,

284
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:50,364
now can I?

285
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,906
Great.

286
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:51,906
Then from here on in,

287
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,659
your wish is my command.

288
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,956
Oh. Um. Okay.

289
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:03,293
I would like you to...

290
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,380
Hm...

291
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:11,510
Oh...

292
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,137
Help me take some of the pie

293
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,137
you made to--

294
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,889
Rarity?

295
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,889
Uh...

296
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:18,808
Sure. Why not?

297
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,062
I helped bake it.

298
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,438
Ugh.

299
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,959
You even look good

300
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,959
when you're chewing.

301
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:50,298
Who looks good

302
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:50,298
when they're chewing?

303
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,632
Aren't you gonna have

304
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:51,632
some more?

305
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,343
I had a big lunch.

306
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,802
It's 10 in the morning.

307
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,971
Breakfast.

308
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:56,971
A big breakfast.

309
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,598
Oh. Okay.

310
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,016
Maybe you could take her plate

311
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,016
back to the kitchen

312
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,268
and wash it off?

313
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,103
As you wish.

314
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,979
What was

315
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:04,979
that all about?

316
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,815
Ah, I saved Spike

317
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:07,815
from some timber wolves

318
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,859
in the Everfree Forest

319
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:09,859
and now he thinks

320
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,819
he has to serve me forever.

321
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,819
Oh!

322
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,907
What I wouldn't give to have

323
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:15,907
some pony forever in my debt.

324
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,700
I'd get them

325
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,700
to organize my closets

326
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,078
and give me pedicures

327
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:20,078
and help me with my sewing--

328
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,747
Okay, I get it. Having somepony

329
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,747
to do things for you

330
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,998
would be

331
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,998
a dream come true.

332
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,584
But I don't feel right

333
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,169
having Spike thinking

334
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,169
he owes me something.

335
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,588
And you tasted

336
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,588
that pie.

337
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,923
Sometimes his help isn't

338
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,923
that helpful.

339
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,092
( crash )

340
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,636
Do you have

341
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,636
a broom I could borrow?

342
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,683
A.J., Rary.

343
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,683
What's happening?

344
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,311
Applejack saved Spike's life

345
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,937
and now he has

346
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,937
to serve her forever.

347
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,315
Sweet. What are you

348
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,315
having him do?

349
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,899
Wash your laundry?

350
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,899
Clean your room?

351
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,359
Help you

352
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,359
with your unfinished novel?

353
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,069
Mine's about this awesome

354
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,069
Pegasus

355
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,904
who's the best flyer ever

356
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,904
and becomes the captain

357
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,531
of the Wonderbolts.

358
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,576
How ever did you come

359
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,576
up with that ingeniously woven,

360
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,035
intricate plot line?

361
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,745
Just came to me.

362
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,248
Thing is I don't really want him

363
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,248
to serve me forever.

364
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,000
But I don't know how

365
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,000
to get him to stop.

366
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,835
That's easy.

367
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,921
Just make him help you with

368
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,921
something really, really hard.

369
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,173
I don't know.

370
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,591
I don't want him to get hurt.

371
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,675
Please.

372
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,675
He'll quit way before

373
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,677
there's even a chance

374
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,677
of getting hurt.

375
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,431
( crash )

376
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,475
Leave this

377
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,475
to me.

378
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,686
So, Spike, Applejack was gonna

379
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,686
help me stack some hay

380
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,772
so I could practice smashing

381
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,772
through it,

382
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,733
but I'm feeling extra,

383
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,733
extra powerful today.

384
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,027
You are?

385
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:35,570
Yeah, I am.

386
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:36,904
So instead of hay,

387
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,157
I'm gonna

388
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,157
smash through rocks.

389
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,076
Rocks?

390
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:42,076
Yeah, a tower of rocks.

391
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,120
And you're gonna build it.

392
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,788
I am?

393
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:45,788
Yeah.

394
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,915
I mean, unless you don't want

395
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,915
to help Applejack.

396
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,167
I do.

397
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,585
It is Spike's Dragon Code.

398
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,379
Then get to it.

399
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:55,298
Trust me.

400
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,552
This is going to work like

401
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,552
a charm.

402
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,137
( panting )

403
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,058
Huh. I was sure he'd give up

404
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:05,058
after, like, three rocks.

405
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,310
Oh, goodness.

406
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,310
If it'd been me,

407
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,188
I'd have just pretended I didn't

408
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:10,188
have anything for him to do.

409
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,731
Why didn't I think

410
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:12,731
of that?

411
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,484
SPIKE:

412
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,484
Is this is high enough?

413
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,818
APPLEJACK:

414
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:15,818
That's plenty high.

415
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,654
Come on down, Spike.

416
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,990
Bad news: He actually ended up

417
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,990
building the whole rock tower.

418
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,702
Good news:

419
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,664
I've got a rock tower

420
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,664
to knock down.

421
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,040
( Spike laughing and cheering )

422
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,291
You can do it.

423
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:31,543
( Spike laughing )

424
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,878
All right! Yeah!

425
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,881
( loud crash )

426
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:41,344
That was awesome.

427
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,887
Wanna do it again,

428
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,887
Rainbow Dash?

429
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,514
Applejack can re-build it

430
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,514
for you.

431
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,561
And when I say "Applejack,"

432
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:49,561
I of course mean me.

433
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,105
Sure. Why not?

434
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:53,440
No.

435
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,275
I mean, I don't

436
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,275
think Rainbow Dash

437
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,693
needs any more

438
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,693
of your help.

439
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,445
My help--

440
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,445
She doesn't need it.

441
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,697
Right,

442
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,697
Rainbow Dash?

443
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,156
Yeah.

444
00:13:02,282 --> 00:13:04,367
I guess I'm good.

445
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,661
For now.

446
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,661
And so am I.

447
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,787
I just can't think of one more

448
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:08,787
thing I need help with.

449
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,667
So you don't have

450
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,667
to do anything else.

451
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,252
What do you mean you can't think

452
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,252
of anything else

453
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:15,503
I can help with?

454
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,755
Exactly that.

455
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,047
There's nothing else.

456
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,591
I don't want you

457
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,591
to do anything.

458
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,509
If I don't help you,

459
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,509
how will I know

460
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,011
I'm a noble dragon?

461
00:13:21,635 --> 00:13:24,011
Well, uh--

462
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,680
Maybe there's things you need

463
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,680
help with

464
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,265
that you don't even realize

465
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,265
that you need help with.

466
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,477
If she needed help

467
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,477
I think she'd realize it.

468
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,936
Maybe not.

469
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,605
Maybe Applejack needs help

470
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,605
realizing

471
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,231
what she needs help with.

472
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,234
Like,

473
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:38,234
maybe your back itches.

474
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,654
That does feel good.

475
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,363
( laughing ):

476
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,363
See?

477
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,907
Or you might need help

478
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,907
remembering your favorite song.

479
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,327
♪ The dragon is

480
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,327
The finest creature ever ♪

481
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,747
♪ There's more to him

482
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,747
Than just guarding treasure ♪

483
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,791
I don't think that's her

484
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,791
favorite--

485
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,833
Or you might need help

486
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,833
breathing.

487
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,835
Breathing?

488
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,835
I certainly do not--

489
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,509
See? There are plenty of things

490
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,509
I can help you with.

491
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,051
And you don't even have

492
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,051
to trouble yourself

493
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,637
with thinking of them.

494
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,637
No. I'll think of them.

495
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:06,971
Let me think of them.

496
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,267
As you wish.

497
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,395
Twilight? Twilight,

498
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:14,395
are you there?

499
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:20,485
Twilight.

500
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,111
Ah!

501
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,111
Sorry.

502
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,363
I didn't mean to scare you.

503
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,114
( sighs ):

504
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,114
No, it's okay.

505
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,449
I need to take

506
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,449
a break anyway.

507
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,701
What's going on?

508
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:28,951
I know Spike told you

509
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,745
that he was gonna follow

510
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:30,745
his Dragon Code

511
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,080
and serve me forever for saving

512
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,080
him from the timber wolves

513
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,415
and that you were okay

514
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,415
with it, but--

515
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,250
Wait. What?

516
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,796
He said he told you

517
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:39,796
all about it.

518
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,674
I'm guessing maybe you were

519
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,674
a little distracted

520
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,009
when he told you.

521
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,009
Maybe a little.

522
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,012
Should've realized you wouldn't

523
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,012
have let him go so easily.

524
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,723
Well, now that you know what's

525
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,723
going on,

526
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,265
maybe you could talk some sense

527
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,265
into him.

528
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,892
Oh, Applejack,

529
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,892
I wish I could,

530
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,645
but this is the Dragon Code

531
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:55,645
we're talking about.

532
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,648
Surely you know how important

533
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,648
the Dragon Code is to a dragon?

534
00:14:58,773 --> 00:15:00,608
I sure am starting to.

535
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,985
There's only one other way Spike

536
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:02,985
is gonna fulfill

537
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,656
the debt he feels he owes you.

538
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:07,907
Seventy,

539
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:13,329
71, 72, 73, 74, 75...

540
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,164
All right, you all,

541
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,164
here's the deal,

542
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,291
Spike needs to save my life.

543
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,502
And you want us to shoot you

544
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,502
out of a cannon

545
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,295
toward a hornet's nest

546
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,295
and give Spike a butterfly net

547
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,297
so he can catch you mere seconds

548
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,297
before you hit the nest

549
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,383
and are stung

550
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,383
by a angry hornets.

551
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,886
I'll wear this moustache.

552
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,348
No. I am gonna be attacked

553
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:32,348
by a timber wolf.

554
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,059
( both gasp )

555
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,062
Can I still wear

556
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:38,062
the moustache?

557
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,859
APPLEJACK:

558
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,859
When I give the signal,

559
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,859
Pinky Pie and Rarity

560
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,402
will come running

561
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,402
out of the woods

562
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,320
being pursued

563
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:46,320
by the timber wolf.

564
00:15:46,446 --> 00:15:47,655
I'll start to run too,

565
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,866
but then pretend to get

566
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:49,866
my hoof stuck.

567
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,659
I'll ask Spike

568
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,659
to help me dislodge it.

569
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,536
And he will

570
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,536
and I'll be able to get away

571
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,538
from the terrifying timber wolf.

572
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,373
Having saved me

573
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,373
from certain doom,

574
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,375
Spike will then consider

575
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,375
us even.

576
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,668
Everybody get it?

577
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,002
Uh-huh.

578
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:02,002
Uh-huh.

579
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,506
I'll do my best.

580
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,300
Just one question.

581
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,427
Yes.

582
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,929
No.

583
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,723
Suit yourself.

584
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,099
( clears throat )

585
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,852
We're all ready

586
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,852
to play our parts,

587
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,105
but are you sure you're ready

588
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:21,105
to play yours, Applejack?

589
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,441
What do you mean?

590
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:23,441
Show us your best

591
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,276
damsel-in-distress move.

592
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,655
Uh...oh,

593
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,655
well, uh...

594
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,948
How's this?

595
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,908
Whoo!

596
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:34,034
Absolutely horrendous.

597
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,287
Okay, this needs

598
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,287
some serious work.

599
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,039
Now, first you must

600
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:39,039
lift your foreleg

601
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,041
up to your forehead

602
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,041
like so.

603
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,502
SPIKE:

604
00:16:41,167 --> 00:16:42,502
Applejack.

605
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:43,878
No time.

606
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,129
Here he comes.

607
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,465
Uh, over here, Spike.

608
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,717
You said you had something else

609
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,717
you needed me to do?

610
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,636
Oh. Yes, I...

611
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,680
I was just hoping

612
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,680
you could maybe, uh,

613
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,265
sweep up all those leaves

614
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:56,265
for a compost pile.

615
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,476
But, of course.

616
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,561
Oh, by the way,

617
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:00,561
there are exactly

618
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:03,564
24,567,837

619
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,733
blades of grass

620
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,733
at Sweet Apple Acres.

621
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,195
I can't believe you counted

622
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,195
every single one of them.

623
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,156
SPIKE:

624
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,156
You asked me to.

625
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,156
And as a noble dragon

626
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,826
and follower

627
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:14,826
of my Dragon Code, I--

628
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:16,744
( Rainbow Dash roaring )

629
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,541
That was very

630
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:21,541
convincing.

631
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,376
RARITY:

632
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:23,376
Timber wolf!

633
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,087
( sobbing ):

634
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,087
We are doomed!

635
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,757
( screaming )

636
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,803
See? Like that.

637
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,393
( hooves beating )

638
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,986
( laughing )

639
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,697
( roaring )

640
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,409
APPLEJACK:

641
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,409
Oh, no.

642
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,327
I seem to have got

643
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:58,327
my hoof caught

644
00:17:58,452 --> 00:17:59,954
in between two rocks.

645
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,248
I cannot run away.

646
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,710
I am a damsel

647
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,710
in distress.

648
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,837
Help me, Spike.

649
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,257
Wait a minute.

650
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,596
No, no.

651
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,596
Don't wait a minute.

652
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,516
Save me from the terrifying

653
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:20,516
timber wolf.

654
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,435
Well, he would be terrifying

655
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,854
if he

656
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,854
wasn't...a fake.

657
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,941
You got the clomping

658
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:27,941
of his claws.

659
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:29,817
The roar was spot on.

660
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,279
And the detail on his face

661
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,279
is pretty good.

662
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,948
But you forgot

663
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,948
one thing.

664
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,908
His breath.

665
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,908
You can smell a real

666
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,284
Timber wolf's breath

667
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:38,284
from a mile--

668
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,619
( both sniffing )

669
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,870
( laughing )

670
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,872
Too late.

671
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:42,872
I'm already on--

672
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,373
( Twilight Sparkle screams )

673
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,542
RAINBOW DASH:

674
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:46,542
Timber wolf!

675
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:49,587
( snarls )

676
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:52,131
( all roaring )

677
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,800
SPIKE:

678
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,800
Timber wolf!

679
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,853
( screams )

680
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:07,146
( crashing )

681
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:08,564
Ow.

682
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,611
Uh-oh.

683
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,866
Applejack, come on.

684
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,451
( straining )

685
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,662
I can't.

686
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,662
I'm really stuck.

687
00:19:24,122 --> 00:19:25,372
No more messing around.

688
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,710
Let's go.

689
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,337
( Applejack straining )

690
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:33,047
( growling )

691
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,882
Come on.

692
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,385
( roaring )

693
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,471
Forget it, Spike.

694
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,223
You gotta

695
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:43,223
get out of here.

696
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,060
Would you just forget

697
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:46,060
your Dragon Code already and go.

698
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,813
( timber wolf roars )

699
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,813
No.

700
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,523
I have to save you.

701
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,736
( hacking )

702
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,697
Let's get out of here.

703
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,573
( grunting )

704
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,495
( coughing )

705
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,757
What happened to you

706
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,757
guys back there?

707
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,176
Thought you were

708
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,176
right behind us.

709
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,593
My hoof was stuck

710
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,013
and that timber wolf

711
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,013
was coming right at me.

712
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,723
Wait, you were

713
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,723
actually stuck?

714
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,725
Uh-huh.

715
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:25,725
But Spike picked up a pebble

716
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,728
and rocketed that thing right

717
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:28,728
at the huge timber wolf's mouth

718
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,688
and saved my life.

719
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:32,648
Ah, it was nothing.

720
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,108
It was something

721
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,108
all right.

722
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,902
Of course I wouldn't

723
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,902
have needed help

724
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,695
if I hadn't been trying

725
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,695
to stage a fake

726
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,780
Timber wolf attack

727
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,780
in the first place.

728
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,282
Yeah.

729
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,282
What was that all about?

730
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,701
( sighs )

731
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,452
I know this code thing's

732
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,452
important to you,

733
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,872
but if something like this

734
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,872
comes up in the future,

735
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,707
think maybe we can

736
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,707
go back to my code,

737
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,291
say that's what

738
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,291
friends do,

739
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,127
and leave

740
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,127
it at that?

741
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,714
I promise I won't think

742
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,714
of you as any less noble.

743
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,133
Sounds good to me.

744
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,763
But maybe let's just try

745
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,763
to avoid situations

746
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:05,223
where one of us actually needs

747
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,515
the other one

748
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,515
to save their life.

749
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,350
You got yourself a deal.

750
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,613
Thanks, Spike.

751
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,613
Happy to help.

752
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,531
Don't know what I'd do

753
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,531
without you.

754
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,911
No, really. I'm really, really,

755
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,911
really happy to help you.

756
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,287
( laughs )

757
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,414
TWILIGHT SPARKLE:

758
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:30,414
