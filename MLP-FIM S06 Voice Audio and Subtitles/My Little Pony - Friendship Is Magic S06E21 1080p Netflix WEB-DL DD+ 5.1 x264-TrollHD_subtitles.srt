00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,413
you can give me

390
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,413
more highlights.

391
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,627
Sure thing,

392
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,627
Starlight Glimmer.

393
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,754
Fluttershy? Where

394
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,754
are all the animals?

395
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,173
They ran away.

396
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,342
And why didn't

397
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,342
you stop them?

398
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,760
Because you

399
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,760
didn't ask me to.

400
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,473
Obviously I wanted

401
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,473
you to... never mind.

402
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,267
Can you please round up all

403
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:06,267
the animals in the castle

404
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,186
and bring them back

405
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,186
here to the foyer.

406
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,313
All the animals. Got it.

407
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,401
Did you find a place to

408
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,401
chillax, Rainbow Dash?

409
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,777
Sure thing,

410
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,777
Starlight Glimmer.

411
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,779
Great. Let me know

412
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:18,779
when it's ready.

413
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,657
Yes, Starlight Glimmer!

414
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,913
Granny Smith knew she was

415
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,913
gonna need a bigger boat.

416
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,874
So Goldie Delicious says, "If

417
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,874
you can't say anything nice

about anypony...

00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,672
Big Mac knew if he just

421
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,672
covered himself in mud,

422
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,798

423
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,798
be able to see him.

Isn't it gorgeous?

00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:44,805
What is that?

428
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,391
You wanted me

429
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,391
to make a dress

430
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,018

431
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:49,018
one in the book.

instructions in the cookbook

450
00:13:24,803 --> 00:13:26,847
in order, Starlight Glimmer!

451
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,727
I meant just the ONE cake! I

452
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,727
was only gone a few minutes!

00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,021
How in Equestria did you get

454
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:34,021
all of this done so fast?

455
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,856

470
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:11,142
Oh yes, this will do

471
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:11,142
nicely. A MUCH bigger dress!

it was the worst

of apples.

476
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:20,109
I can handle this. It's just

477
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:20,109
magic and I know magic.

The cakes are burning!

00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:31,954
You left the ovens on!

483
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,914
We need water!

Fiducia Compelus and Cogeria.

501
00:15:24,507 --> 00:15:27,343

too much Persuadere.

You're really missing

505
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,472
the point here.

506
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,974
I finally untangled

507
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,974
that mess of a spell

508
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,812
and got everypony home. It

509
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,812
was really powerful stuff.

how in the name

out of control?

518
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,989
Well, it was the first time

519
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,989
I cast that particular spell

520
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,575
and I didn't fully

521
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,575
think it through.

522
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,992
I bet if I had reversed--

523
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,120
I think you might be

524
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,120
missing the point here.

525
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,580
Told ya.

526
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,290
What made you think

527
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,290
that casting a spell

528
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,958
on your friends

to do your bidding

530
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,001
was even remotely

531
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,001
a good idea?

532
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,798
Well, when you put it that

533
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,798
way, it sounds really bad.

534
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,007
That's because it

535
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,007
IS really bad!

00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,009

You've been doing so well.

540
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,725
I just don't understand

541
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,519
how a friendship lesson

542
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:18,519
turned into all of this?

543
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:21,021
Ugh. Fine!

544
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,150
I've been avoiding the

545
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:24,150
friendship lessons on purpose.

546
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,610
Why?

547
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,278
I can cast complex spells.

548
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,698
But baking a cake with

549
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,698

550
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,409
And yes I know how

551
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,409
ridiculous that sounds.

552
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,077
That's why I didn't

553
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,077
say anything.

554
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,037
I thought if I just

555
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,037
kept wowing you

556
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,668
with my magical abilities,

557
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:41,668
you might just... not notice.

Baking a cake

00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,878
freaks you out?

560
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,632
Yes! Baking a cake,

561
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,632
sewing. All of it.

562
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,676
What if I was

563
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,676
bad at it?

564
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,094
I didn't want to be a

565
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,094
disappointment to anypony

566
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,974
and I ended up being a

567
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,974
disappointment to everypony.

568
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,142
Starlight. Do you

569
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,142
think anypony cares

570
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,102
if you can bake a cake?

571
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,688
But the lesson--

572
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,606
Was to get to know

573
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,606
Pinkie Pie better

574
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:05,817

she loves.

576
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,153
It was a friendship lesson,

577
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:09,153
not a baking lesson.

578
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,406
Oh. You know I think I might

579
00:17:09,195 --> 00:17:12,406
have missed the point here.

580
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,700
Told ya.

581
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,201
So now what?

582
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,287
Now it's time for a pretty

583
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:18,287
advanced friendship lesson.

584
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,415
It's called apologizing.

585
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:25,085
[groans]

586
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,048
I dunno what kinda whammy

587
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,048
Starlight put on us,

588
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,009
but I feel like I got

589
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,009
shoved through the

590
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,136
super speedy cider

591
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,136
squeezy 6000.

592
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,597
Ugh! Tell me about it.

593
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:40,351
If everypony could speak in a

594
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:40,351
whisper for the next few days,

595
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,772
that would be delightful.

596
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,772
My head is thumping.

597
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,400
I was up all night

598
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,400
calming the animals down.

599
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,403
<i>Fluttershy, please!</i>

600
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:50,403
<i>Not so loud.</i>

601
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,614
Starlight's spell made me

602
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:53,614
burn perfectly good cake!

603
00:17:53,656 --> 00:17:56,116
I NEVER burn cake!

604
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,118
[Starlight] Yeah, about that...

605
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,872
Things got a little

606
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,872
out of hand last night.

607
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,583
Ain't that the

608
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:03,583
understatement of the day?

609
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,753
Tell it to the cakes, sister!

610
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:11,007
Can we all PLEASE argue

611
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:11,007
at a lower volume?

612
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:13,217
I really messed up.

613
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,596
I cast the spell because I was

614
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,596
nervous about working with you

615
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,598
on the friendship lessons.

616
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,475
Well, here's a friendship

617
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,475
lesson for you.

618
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,979
Don't cast spells

619
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,979
on your friends!

620
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,273
Believe me; I know.

621
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,985
What I did was wrong and

622
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,985
I can't take it back.

623
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,154
You're right to be upset

624
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,154
and I hope one day,

625
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:40,160
I can make it up to you. But

626
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:40,160
all I can say is I'm sorry.

627
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,664
Now if you'll excuse me, I've

628
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:43,664
got to go clean the castle

629
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:47,167
covered in wet cake

630
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:47,167
batter and spiders.

631
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,796
That was a pretty

632
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,796
good apology.

633
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,423
It seems like she

634
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:52,423
feels really bad.

635
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,676
Hey, Starlight! Most of

636
00:18:52,465 --> 00:18:55,676
the Apple family photos

637
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,804
are still laying

638
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,804
around in the wreckage.

639
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,973
I think I'll come along

640
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:59,973
and hunt 'em down.

641
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,391
Oh! And I feel awful for

642
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,391
disturbing all of those

643
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,062
cute little spiders and

644
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:06,062
bats. I should check on them.

645
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,107
Ah, yes. And I left

646
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:09,107
some lovely fabric out;

647
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,192
I should come move it to

648
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,192
that nice quiet library.

649
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,862
Uh, I'll come and get

650
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,862
those storm clouds

651
00:19:14,904 --> 00:19:16,238
out of the bathroom.

652
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,241
Fine! Somepony has to

653
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,241
bake a cake to honor

654
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,286
all of the poor cakes that

655
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:22,286
sacrificed their batter

656
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,288
in last night's tragedy.

657
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:31,420
♪♪

658
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,673
It seems your

659
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,673
apology went well.

660
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,719
[sigh] I'm just lucky to have

661
00:20:15,715 --> 00:20:19,719
such understanding friends.

662
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,345
But it's probably

663
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,345
going to be a while

664
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,264
before I try to tackle those

665
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:24,264
friendship lessons again.

666
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,185
What do you mean? You've

667
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,185
been doing them all day!

668
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,020
What are you

669
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,020
talking about?

670
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,813
I've been cleaning

671
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:30,813
up the mess I made

672
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,523
by totally failing

673
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,523
at friendship.

674
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,860
Really? But didn't I see

675
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,860
you sewing with Rarity?

676
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:37,277
Yes but--

677
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,279
And you and Applejack did

678
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,279
a great job collecting

679
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,240
those photos and putting

680
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,240
them in the book.

681
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,950
Helping animals with Fluttershy,

682
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,451
baking with Pinkie Pie.

683
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,704
Those sound like your

684
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,704
assignments to me.

685
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,083
In fact, I think there's just

686
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:50,083
one that you're missing.

687
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,502
Sun? Check. Chairs? Check.

688
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,255
And thanks to a simple

689
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,255
catadupa levitata spell,

690
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,675
we've got water! Is that

691
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,675
everything we need to chillax?

692
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,843
Nope.

693
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:03,512
No? What did I miss?

694
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:05,305
Quiet.

695
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,016
Ah. Right.

696
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:08,475
Great job, Starlight.

697
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,604
Looks like you've completed

698
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,604
another friendship lesson.

699
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,147
[happy sigh]

700
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:17,110
Hey! She completes the lesson

701
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:17,110
when I say she completes it.

702
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:21,239
So less learning

703
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:21,239
and more chillaxing!

704
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,829
So, how long do we

705
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:28,829
sit quietly?

706
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:32,959
[laughter]
