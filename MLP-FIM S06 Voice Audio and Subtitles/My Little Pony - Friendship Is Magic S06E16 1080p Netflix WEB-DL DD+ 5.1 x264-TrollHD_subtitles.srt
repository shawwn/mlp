4
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,049

00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,218
to come back to the Crystal

6
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,218
Empire for a visit.

7
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,638
But I just know Flurry Heart's

8
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,638

00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,056
I wonder if I'll

10
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,056
even recognize her.

11
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,309
She's the only baby

12
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,309
they have, Twilight.

13
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,771
I think it'll be pretty easy

14
00:00:17,351 --> 00:00:20,771
to figure out who she is.

15
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,063
Mm.

16

18
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,444
and I'm excited to

19
00:00:25,192 --> 00:00:27,444
see Sunburst again.

20
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,070
I just don't want

21
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,070
to fall behind

22
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:31,156
on my friendship

23

24
00:00:31,198 --> 00:00:34,493
Starlight, your work in

25

38
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:58,350
Because you're YOU... in

39
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:58,350
a coat, hat, and glasses.

40
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,060
Also, we're the

41
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:00,060
only ones here.

42
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,771
Right.

43
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,482
Spike, why do you

44
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,482
need a disguise?

45

46
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:07,150

48
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,277
on with the new baby

49
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,404
and the Crystalling,

50
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,197
but I still got

51
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,197
mobbed in the street.

52
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,534
I wouldn't say "mobbed."

53
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,912
And this is just

54
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,912

55
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,121
I wouldn't want the presence of

56
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,121
"Spike the Brave and Glorious"

57
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,124

58
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,124

But still, I don't

64
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:31,132
think your presence

65
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:33,134

Spike the Brave and Glorious

194
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,303
you're talking to. Have you ever

195
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:44,303
known me to run from danger?

196
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:46,013
Ummmm...

197
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,015
He'll be safe with our guards.

198
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,893
Or will your guards

199
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,893
be safe with me?

200
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:52,853
[sigh]

201
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,398
Spike, the Brave and Glorious.

202
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,109
You've faced the evil

203
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,109
Changelings before.

204
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,694
What can you tell us?

205
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:06,283
Oh. Um. Well, they are

206
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:06,283
Changelings, so they can change.

207
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,743
Do you hear that? These monsters

208
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:08,743
can look like any of us,

209
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,497
so be on guard, guards.

210
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:12,497
Even more than normal.

211
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,876
And they could be anywhere.

212
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,670
So we should cover as

213
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:18,670
much ground as possible.

214
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:21,422
You, search that way!

215
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,465
[whoosh]

216
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,343
And you search that way!

217
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,344
[whoosh]

218
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:32,100
And I'll just search

219
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:32,100
here, I guess.

220
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,354
Not many places to hide.

221
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,981
Unless that rock

222
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:37,981
is a Changeling.

223
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,526
OK, "rock", how do I know

224
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,526
you're really a rock?

225
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:46,990
Hmm not talking, huh?

226
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:46,990
Well, you can't fool me.

227
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,283
Whoa!

228
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:54,455
[screaming]

229
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,623
[grunt]

230
00:06:59,378 --> 00:07:02,797
Whew. [kissing noises]

231
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,467
OK. Maybe it's time Spike

232
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:06,467
the Brave and Glorious

233
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,470
went back to, ah,

234
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,470
protect those guards.

235
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,972
[surprised yell]

236
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,849
Phew. Just my reflection.

237
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,727
Huh?

238
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,778
Ha hah! Hmm, just my

239
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:24,778
imagination, I guess.

240
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:25,946
[thud]

241
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,285
AUGGGGGHHHH!

242
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:39,084
Ch-ch-ch-changeling!!

243
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,502
No, wait! Come back!

244
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,462
AAAAHHHHHH!

245
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,800
AAAAHHHHHH!

246
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,220
This is unexpected.

247
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,392
The ice is pretty slippery.

248
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,770
I wouldn't want you to

249
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,770
get hurt because of me.

250
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,648
You... saved me?

251
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:06,069
It's OK. I know you

252
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:06,069
don't want to be friends.

253
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,528
Wait!

254
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,659
I don't understand. Changelings

255
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,659
are supposed to be evil, right?

256
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,538
Evil? Oh, not me. All I've

257
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:17,538
ever wanted is a friend.

258
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,001
From the moment I first split

259
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,001
my egg in the nursery hive.

260
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:25,672
[hissing]

261
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,556
I was part of the

262
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,556
attack on Canterlot

263
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,850
during the Royal Wedding.

264
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,519
But I'd never seen true

265
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,519
friendship like that,

266
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,481
and I couldn't just steal

267
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,481
it and feed on its love.

268
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,731
I wanted to share it!

269
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,863
After that, I knew I couldn't

270
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,863
live with my kind anymore.

271
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,949
I set off looking for

272
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,949
love to share. But--

273
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,575
But what?

274
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,370
I'm starving!

275
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,580
And there's so much love in

276
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,580
the Crystal Empire right now.

277
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:04,336
It's what drew me here,

278
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:04,336
but it's driving me crazy!

279
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,962
That would be from

280
00:09:04,378 --> 00:09:05,962
the Royal Crystalling.

281
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,382
It's pretty much a giant

282
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:08,382
outpouring of light and love

283
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,674
for a new baby.

284
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:14,179
[hiss] Oh, sorry.

285
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:14,179
I'm just so hungry.

286
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,765
If I had a friend, maybe the

287
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,765
love we shared could sustain me,

288
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,270
but I don't think the Crystal

289
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:22,270
Ponies want to be friends.

290
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,066
What if I told you there was

291
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:26,066
somepony they respect and admire

292
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,652
so much, he could convince

293
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:29,652
them to give it a try?

294
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,405
If only that were true!

295
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:35,575
It is! I mean, I

296
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:35,575
am. It's ME! Spike!

297
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,623
Spike? The Brave and Glorious?

298
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:42,623
I'm sure you've heard of me.

299
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,627
No, but I was raised by

300
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,627
an evil queen. I'm Thorax.

301
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,130
I can't believe you

302
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,130
want to help me.

303
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:53,718
Why? Hasn't anypony ever

304
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:53,718
just been nice to you?

305
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,641
[hiss] Sorry! Sorry! Kindness

306
00:09:53,760 --> 00:10:00,641
like that kind of brings it out.

307
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,643
Do you still want

308
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,643
to be my friend?

309
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,565
Of course! And I am one

310
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:06,565
hundred percent sure

311
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,900
I can get the whole Crystal

312
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,900
Empire to be your friend too.

313
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,652
[hiss]

314
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,948
But, maybe I should just uh,

315
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,948
talk to them first.

316
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,744
What do you mean? Did

317
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,744
you see the Changeling?

318
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,955
Did you defeat

319
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,955
the evil creature?

320
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,665
Defeating a Changeling

321
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,665
would be brave,

322
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,667
but do you know what

323
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:26,667
would be glorious?

324
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,669
Defeating two Changelings?

325
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,631
Defeating all the Changelings?

326
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,674
Not having to fight

327
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,674
the Changeling at all

328
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,760
because I made

329
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,760
friends with him.

330
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:42,683
Ha hah! Oh. Wow. For a second

331
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:42,683
I thought you were serious!

332
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:47,688
Ha ha! Could you imagine?

333
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:47,688
Friends with a Changeling?

334
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,567
I am serious. He

335
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,567
wants to be friends.

336
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:54,695
Ha ha ha! Right!

337
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,031
Not only are you Spike

338
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,031
the Brave and Glorious,

339
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,243
you're also Spike

340
00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,243
the Hilarious! Ha ha!

341
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,787
I'm not joking. The

342
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:02,787
Changeling is nice.

343
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,874
HA HA HA!

344
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,710
I'm sorry. But I don't

345
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,710
think it's funny.

346
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,713
The Changeling Queen,

347
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,713
Chrysalis, kidnapped Cadance

348
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,424
and cast a spell on me.

349
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,306
There's no such thing

350
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:21,306
as a nice Changeling.

351
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:26,102
You're right, Shining Armor.

352
00:11:21,348 --> 00:11:26,102
Sorry. That was a... bad joke.

353
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,484
So? So! What did they say? How

354
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:32,484
many new friends do I have?

355
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,695
Well... it didn't go

356
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:36,695
exactly the way I thought.

357
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:43,662
Uh, I understand. Well,

358
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:43,662
thanks for trying.

359
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,289
I-I guess it's not surprising.

360
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,750
How can you expect ponies

361
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:49,750
who look like this.

362
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:55,089
To trust something

363
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:55,089
that looks like this?

364
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:57,133
I think I might know.

365
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,352
Spike, if you're done

366
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,352
searching for the Changeling,

367
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,936
Starlight and I

368
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,936
could use your help.

369
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,772
We're working on a protection

370
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:11,772
spell for Flurry Heart

371
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,775
and nopony takes

372
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:14,775
notes like you.

373
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:17,571
Uh actually, Twilight,

374
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,781
I wanted to introduce

375
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:20,781
you to my friend, um...

376
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,784
...Crystal! ...Hoof!

377
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,706
Crystal Hoof, my good

378
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,706
friend, Crystal Hoof.

379
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:29,790
Nice to meet you.

380
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:34,337
Oh. Well, it's nice to meet you

381
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:34,337
too. How do you know Spike?

382
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,964

00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:29,311
And if Spike says Thorax is his

572
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:29,311
friend, then he's my friend too.

573
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,150
Thank you.

574
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:38,112
On behalf of the Crystal Empire,

575
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:38,112
I would like to extend my hoof

576
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,865
in friendship and I am

577
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:40,865
sure all of my subjects

578
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,950
are eager to do the same.

579
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:47,997
[cheers]! Yay!

580
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,588
Welcome to the Crystal

581
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,588
Empire, Thorax.

582
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,298
I'm sorry we didn't take the

583
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:58,298
time to get to know you.

584
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,760
Maybe we can change that now.

585
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:04,513
That'd be so amazing! I want

586
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:04,513
to know all about friendship.

587
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,933
And maybe one day I can

588
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,933
take that knowledge back

589
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,684
to the Changeling Kingdom.

590
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:12,021
If my kind learned how to

591
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:12,021
create love for one another,

592
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,398
maybe they wouldn't have

593
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,398
to take it from others!

594
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,525
To Spike the Brave and Glorious!

595
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:21,572
[cheers]

596
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,744
Looks like you were

597
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:26,744
right after all.

598
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,204
Right about what?

599
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,873
Friendship lessons

600
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,873
can happen anywhere.
