Celestia: Indeed.

592
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,208
I'm glad to see

593
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,208
you've found a way

You may be more of a

We have Sunburst

I hope he takes his role

as Crystaller seriously.

Something tells me the baby

618
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:58,750
will need a pony like him

619
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:00,750

the entire visit just

625
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:08,375
calling her "the baby"?

We were thinking, Flurry Heart.

That's a big responsibility.

I can't think of

643

What are you talking about?

Your lesson went perfectly.

Starlight and Sunburst

655
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,041
got over their past

656
00:20:58,083 --> 00:20:59,291
and rekindled their friendship.

657
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,750
No thanks to me.

658
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,458
I know a lot happened; I

659
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,458
just wish I could have given

660
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,709
my pupil the attention

661
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,709
she deserves.

662
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,792
Well, I know she needed to

663
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,792
be put on the right path,

664
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,250
but giving her the space

665
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,250
to make her own decisions

666
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,417

You know, I never thought

670
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,542
about it, but I guess it is.

671

Maybe you're a better

672
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:24,709
