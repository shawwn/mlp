00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,542
OK. Library... library... Where

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,542
did they put the library?

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,458
[sigh] This Castle looked a

4
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,458
lot smaller from the outside.

5
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:22,834
Morning, Starlight.

6
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,458
Whoops!

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,083
Sorry, Spike! I guess I'm still

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:28,083
trying to find my way around.

9
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:31,291
You don't happen to know

10
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:31,291
where the library is, do you?

11
00:00:31,333 --> 00:00:32,375
Next door on the left.

12
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:33,875
[slam]

13
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:35,709
Oh. Thanks.

14
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,875
Acceptance, mm-hmm,

15
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:39,875
Altruism, definitely.

16
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:42,166
Starlight! Good

17
00:00:39,917 --> 00:00:42,166
morning! Come in!

18
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,959
Sorry I'm late. I got

19
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,959
a little turned around.

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,750
I still can't believe you're

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,750
letting me stay here.

22
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:51,959
As your pupil. After

23
00:00:47,792 --> 00:00:51,959
everything I did.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,125
Well, I'm not one to dwell on

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,125
the past and neither should you.

26
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:59,166
The castle is your home now and

27
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:59,166
as far as being my pupil goes...

28
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,417
I was just trying to figure out

29
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,709
what your first friendship

30
00:01:00,458 --> 00:01:02,709
lesson should be!

31
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,542
Oh. Well, it looks like you're

32
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,542
really narrowing it down.

33
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,750
Oh, these are just the As. After

34
00:01:05,583 --> 00:01:08,750

learning about friendship,

58
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:59,166
but I didn't think there were

59
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:59,166
this many lessons for anything.

60
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,875
How do we choose?

61
00:02:00,917 --> 00:02:03,834
Maybe I should pare things down

62

a bit before we go through them.

63

They're planning our trip

to the Crystal Empire

67
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,083
when Shining Armor and Princess

68
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:11,083
Cadance have their baby.

69
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:12,125
Throne room. Got it!

70
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:17,375
Um, which way is

72
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,542
[sigh]

73
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,792
Rainbow Dash: Well, I think

74
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,792
we should leave ASAP!

75
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,583
I don't want to miss

76
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:23,583
the Crystalling!

77
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,792
But, um, shouldn't we

78
00:02:23,625 --> 00:02:26,792
wait for the invitation?

79
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,417
Frankly, I'm not exactly

80
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,417
clear on all the customs

81
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,417
and traditions of

82
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,417
the Crystal Empire.

83
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,542
Especially when it

84
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,542
comes to a Crystalling.

85
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:35,208
What's a Crystalling?

86
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,500
Well, that's just

87
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,500
it, Darling.

88
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,667
Princess Cadance and Shining

89
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,667
Armor's baby is due any day

90
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,667
and we're still not sure.

91
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,083
The Crystal Empire was

92
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:46,083
gone for a thousand years.

93
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,083
A lot of their customs

94
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,083
are a bit murky.

95
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,375
We know it's got something

96
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,375
to do with the new baby.

97
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:52,500
And a party!

98
00:02:52,542 --> 00:02:54,083
And the Crystal Heart.

99
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,250
And a party!

100
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,417
And some kind of cool energy.

101
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:58,792
And...

102
00:02:58,834 --> 00:03:00,083
A PARTY!

103
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,625
Spike: It's not

104
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,625
hard to understand.

105
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,834
Most things in the

106
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:07,834
Crystal Empire aren't.

107
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,792
Like how I'm a big hero

108
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:10,792
there, for example.

109
00:03:17,667 --> 00:03:18,667
Plus, I've had to help Twilight

110
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,417
do a lot of research

111
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:20,417
on Crystallings.

112
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,834
Whenever a baby is born

113
00:03:21,792 --> 00:03:23,834
in the Crystal Empire,

114
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,458
the parents bring it

115
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,458
before the Crystal Heart.

116
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,083
They get the purest shard

117
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,083
of crystal they can find,

118
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,250
then pick a Crystaller

119
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,250
to present the baby

120
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:33,083
to everypony who comes.

121
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,959
Then they all share the

122
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,959
light and joy they feel,

123
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,625
feeding it into the crystal

124
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,625
that joins with the Heart

125
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:41,417
and increases its power.

126
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,709
And this is going to

127
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,709
be a Royal Crystalling,

128
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,792
so pretty much the whole

129
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,792
Empire will show up.

130
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,667
That hasn't happened

131
00:03:45,834 --> 00:03:47,667
in a millennia.

132
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,083
What do you mean it increases

133
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,083
the Crystal Heart's power?

134
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,083
The energy it uses to protect

135
00:03:52,083 --> 00:03:55,083
the Crystal Empire, I guess.

136
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,291
Protect it from what?

137
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,375
I didn't help Twilight

138
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:59,375
with that part.

139
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,375
Hey, Twilight, can

140
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,375
I ask you something

141
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,709
about the Crystal Empire?

142
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,083
Ha! Funny you

143
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,083
should mention it...

144
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,917
Because I just narrowed your

145
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,917
first friendship lesson

146
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,417
down to three options.

147
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,709
And one of them is in

148
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,709
the Crystal Empire.

149
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,291
Really?

150
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,083
I found out that's

151
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,083
where the first pony

152
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,667
you ever cared about lives!

153
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:24,709
Sunburst?

154
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,917
Of course that's just one idea.

155
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:28,917
We could also go to

were right.

168
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,458
It is going to be

169
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,458
hard to choose one.

Right. Right!

I'm sorry;

584
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,834
fatherhood is way more

585
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:38,834
stressful than I ever thought.

the crystal of purity

589
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,417
is a very important decision,

590
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,083
so I have gone through the

591
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,083
trouble of arranging them

592
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:52,250

593
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:52,250
pure to outrageously pure.

Um, Rarity? Don't they

595
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:55,917
all sort of look the same?

Did something happen to you

after I left for Magic School?

616
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:54,542
What? No! I don't see what

617

618
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,166
Why would you even ask that?

I mean, did something

00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:01,667
happen to you

I'm a [ahem] important wizard.

624
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,458
