Now, tell me what's going on. Is

195
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:04,072
it Caballeron? Did you see him?

196
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,490
What? No.

197
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,451
But there is a pony downstairs

198
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,451
who thinks everything

199
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,454
you've written after the first

200
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,454
trilogy is totally unrealistic

201
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,249
and terrible and I need

202
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,249
you to help me prove to him

203
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,126
that it's all

204
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,126
totally possible.

205
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,669
I've got bigger

206
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,669
problems on my hoofs

207
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,378
than dissatisfied

208
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,378
fan-ponies.

209
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:22,716
Whoa!

210
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,594
The Amulet of Culhuacan.

211
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,594
And Caballeron wants it.

212
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,430
But the amulet's

213
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,430
only a key. [chuckle]

214
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,267
The real treasure is

215
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,267
hidden in a lost temple,

216
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,229
The Seven-Sided

217
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:35,229
Chest of Chicomoztoc.

218
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,232
Caballeron wants to sell it to

219
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,232
the highest bidder, of course,

220
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,441
which is why I need

221
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,441
to find it first.

222
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,445
YES! Sounds like another

223
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:44,445
awesome Daring Do Adventure!

224
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,781
But what are

225
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,781
you doing here?

226
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,449
Since I haven't

227
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,449
found the temple yet,

228
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,577
it's the safest place

229
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,577
for me and the Amulet.

230
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,412
It's crawling with security

231
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,412
and if I get into trouble,

232
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,459
I can just blend in with all

233
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:58,459
the Daring Do cos-players.

234
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,836
How can I help?

235
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,463
Just keep your eyes out

236
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,463
for anything suspicious.

237
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,422
Got it.

238
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,300
[knock at door]

239
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,928
Does a pony who only

240
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,928
likes your first trilogy

241
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,554
qualify as suspicious?

242
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,473
Just checking.

243
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,392
[door closes]

244
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:22,109
[sigh] I find all this fanfare

245
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:22,109
around my archenemy disturbing.

246
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,572
I mean, where is the

247
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,572
booth for Caballeron?

248
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,452
I do not see the likeness.

249
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,498
Come. Let us find Daring Do

250
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:37,498
and the Amulet of Culhuacan.

251
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,335
I don't want to spend any

252
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,335
more time in this place

253
00:07:40,377 --> 00:07:41,461
than I have to.

254
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,638
Well, if it isn't the pony

255
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:51,638
who knows impossible things

256
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,392
can happen because

257
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:55,392
she just does.

258
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,603
Ugh. Sorry, Quibble, I've got

259
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,603
more important things to do

260
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,147
than argue with a pony

261
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,482
who thinks awesome

262
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,482
means unrealistic.

263
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,446
No, wait. I wanna hear more

264
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,446
about how you're 100% sure

265
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,031
that in Curse of the Jungle

266
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,031
Queen, Daring Do could survive

267
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,201
a sixty-story drop from

268
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,201
the top of a waterfall

269
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,579
after sustaining a broken

270
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:16,579
wing in a category six rapid.

271
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:17,914
Ugh.

272
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,459
Obviously her wing

273
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:20,459
wasn't broke--

274
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,169
Caballeron!

275
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,545
See, now THAT'S a

276
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,545
great character!

277
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,424
Solid backstory.

278
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,424
Good motivations.

279
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,801
No-no-no! Caballeron

280
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:29,801
is right there!

281
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,346
Of course he is.

282
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,973
He's also over

283
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,973
there, over there,

284
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:39,560
Oh-oh over there,

285
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:39,560
and over there.

286
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,021
Where are you going?

287
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:46,651
And we're out here because...

288
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,569
Daring Do told me

289
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,569
that Caballeron

290
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,572
came to this convention to

291
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,572
steal the Amulet of Culhuacan

292
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,575
and I just saw him and his

293
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,575
henchponies come this way.

294
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,412
OK. I'm gonna head back inside.

295
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,580
Just a little

296
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,580
too much crazy out here

297
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,333
for the both of us.

298
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,459
[gasp]

299
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,300
I do not know what

300
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,300
Daring Do is playing at,

301
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,760
but if she told you two

302
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,760
fanponies of my plan

303
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,391
to steal the Amulet,

304
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:17,391
you must work for her.

305
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,353
Caballeron! HA! What do you

306
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:21,353
have to say NOW, Quibble?

307
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,939
This was your plan to prove the

308
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,939
Daring Do books are realistic?

309
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,609
You bought a "Daring Do

310
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,609
Experience, Adventu-cation"?

311
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,070
Really?

312
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,949
What?! NO! Look around us!

313
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:34,949
Henchponies. Caballeron!

314
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,619
The jungle it took forever to

315
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:38,619
get to! This is the real deal!

316
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,707
Right. We're ACTUALLY being

317
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,707
held captive by Caballeron.

318
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,294
Please. This guy's accent

319
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:46,294
is all over the place.

320
00:09:46,336 --> 00:09:47,462
No offense.

321
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,713
I....

322
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,216
So, what's the setup,

323
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,216
here? You've kidnapped us

324
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,553
and taken us to the middle

325
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,553
of nowhere because....?

326
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,306
The Temple of Chicomoztoc is

327
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:58,306
somewhere in this jungle!

328
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,769
When I find it, the Seven-Sided

329
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:02,769
Chest is as good as mine!

330
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,356
I just need the Amulet of

331
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:06,356
Culhuacan to unlock it!

332
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,900
Uh-huh. And Daring

333
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:08,900
Do has the Amulet,

334
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,652
so you came up with this

335
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,652
overcomplicated plot

336
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,906
to lure her into the jungle

337
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,906
and exchange it for us?

338
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,535
I wouldn't call it

339
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,535
overcomplicated, but yes.

340
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,120
OK, we're done here. Great work.

341
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:22,789
Seriously. Very believable.

342
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,376
[slap and shout]

343
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,671
Listen pal, you can keep

344
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:30,671
her money, but I'm not--

345
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,632
Going anywhere.

346
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:37,137
You may not approve of my plan,

347
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:37,137
but I'm the mastermind here.

348
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,805
Debatable.

349
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,142
AND I SAY you will remain

350
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,142
here until Daring Do

351
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,853
comes to rescue you. And if she

352
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,853
wants you back in one piece,

353
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,815
she will give me the

354
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,815
Amulet! Tie them up.

355
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,445
The Griffon's Lock!

356
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,779
You know of it!

357
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,282
Further proof that you

358
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,282
are an agent of Daring Do.

359
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,658
Or an avid reader.

360
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:04,623
And now I will continue

361
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:04,623
my search for the Temple.

362
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:10,545
Don't go anywhere. [evil laugh]

363
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,089
Listen, if I pretend to

364
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,089
believe this nonsense is real,

365
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:17,676
will you call off the henchpony

366
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:17,676
repertory theater over there?

367
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,930
They're not going to listen

368
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,930
to me. They abducted us BOTH!

369
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,600
Oh, wow. So you're going

370
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,600
to stick with that script?

371
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,978
Oh, OK fine. We're in

372
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:26,978
a Daring Do adventure.

373
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,150
What was that?

374
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,530
DARING DO! THANK

375
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:36,530
GOODNESS! WE'RE OVER HERE!

376
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,200
Fan out! We can't let

377
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,200
Daring Do rescue these two.

378
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,913
All four? I mean, shouldn't at

379
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:45,913
least one of them stay behind

380
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,542
to guard us? Oh-oh

381
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,542
wait, no because then

382
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,752
it wouldn't be a terrible

383
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:51,752
Daring Do adventure!

384
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:53,296
It doesn't matter.

385
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,714
We'll never solve the Griffon's

386

Lock before they get back.

387
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,761
OK, that was pretty good.

388
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,390
Quick! We've got to get out

389
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,390
of here and warn Daring Do!

390
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,766
No way. Just point

391
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,766
me to the hotel

392
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,852
and you can play fanpony

393
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,188
and hunt treasure

394
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:10,188
out here all day long.

395
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,360
Fine. Let's say this IS a

396
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,360
Daring Do Adventu-cation.

397
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,530
The only way to get back to the

398
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:18,530
convention is to go through it.

399
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:22,825
So just follow me and

400
00:12:18,572 --> 00:12:22,825
I'll lead you out. Deal?

401
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,119
Ugh. Fine.

402
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,583
Maybe if I just leave you in

403
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:29,583
the jungle, it'll convince you.

404
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,751
Which would make Daring Do left-

405
00:12:29,624 --> 00:12:32,751
hoofed, which we KNOW is false!

406
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,547
And THAT is everything

407
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,547
that's wrong with Daring Do

408
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,340
and the Trek to the

409
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,340
Terrifying Tower.

410
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,676
Now the problems with

411
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,676
the next book are even--

412
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,890
Oh, right. What Daring Do

413
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:45,890

00:12:45,932 --> 00:12:48,893

416
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:55,149
I'm all for making things

420
00:12:59,153 --> 00:13:01,656
Is it too "realistic" for you?

421
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:04,409
Wouldn't want THAT on a

00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,148
Which lock do YOU think it is?

577
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,611
FINALLY! Look. Each door has

578
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,611
another door that matches.

579
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,114
THESE two both have earth

580
00:17:50,653 --> 00:17:54,114
ponies fighting serpents.

581
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,117
THESE two have Pegasi

582
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,117
fighting Griffons.

583
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:03,123
THESE two have unicorns

584
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:03,123
fighting bears. But THIS one...

585
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:05,209
Has an alicorn on it!

586
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,255
It's the only one without a

587
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:09,255
match. How did I miss that?

588
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,091
I've been asking myself

589
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,091
that ever since book four.

590
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,100
The Seven-Sided

591
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:21,100
Chest of Chicomoztoc.

592
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,104
Uh, guys?

593
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,943
The way out is

594
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:29,943
totally covered!

595
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,945
How are we gonna

596
00:18:29,984 --> 00:18:31,945
get out of here?

597
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:33,863
There!

598
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,824
Seriously, do you

599
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,824
ever NOT escape

600
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,701
out of the top of a temple?

601
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,162
We'll have to carry mister

602
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,162
adventure critic out with us.

603
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,457
We won't be fast enough!

604
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:44,457
We'll never make it!

606
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,420
I think Rainbow Dash

607
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,420
and I have this covered.

can't go over him!

Go over him? Are you crazy?

You SAID go over him!

617
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,865
I SAID go around him!

This way! I heard them!

620
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,414
OK, I've got it. Let's

621
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,414
create a fake treasure

622
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,709
out of mud and rocks, give THAT

623
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,709
to Caballeron and then when--

624
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,171
Not EVERY Daring Do plan

625
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,171
has to be super complicated.

626
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,550
I swear I heard them!

I'll get you Daring Doooooooo!

631
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,649
Uh. Not particularly original

632
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:51,649
or inspired, but it worked.

633
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,775
Who are you again?

634
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:54,360
He's a fan.

635
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,655
Uh-huh. There's some stairs on

636
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:57,655
the other side of the temple

637
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,239
that lead out of

638
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,239
the ravine.

639
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,784
I suggest you two take

640
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,784
them and head west.

641
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:03,243
What about you?

642
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,706
I've got to get this to a

643
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,706
museum. Thanks for your help.

644
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,750
I couldn't have done it

645
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,750
without you. Both of you.

646
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,423
So?

647
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,136
So. Maybe the later books

648
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:20,136
ARE slightly more realistic

649
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,763
than I gave them credit for.

650
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,763
I still don't like them.

651
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:24,264
What? How can you--

652
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,893
Wait! Hold on! Before

653
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,893
we get in another fight,

654
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,269
I think I finally

655
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,269
figured it out!

656
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,024
I love the Daring Do that solves

657
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,024
puzzles and uses her brain

658
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,817
to get out of tough situations.

659
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,236
And she did WAY more of that

660
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,236
in the original trilogy.

661
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,280
YOU love the Daring Do

662
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,280
that is brave and awesome

663
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,283
and comes out on top no

664
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:43,283
matter what the odds.

665
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,911
OK.

666
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,787
And that's OK!

667
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,289
We might never agree on

668
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:49,289
what makes Daring Do cool.

669
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:52,919
But YOU are definitely cool.

670
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,672
I mean the way you saved

671
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,672
me on the bridge? Wow.

672
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:02,929
And escaping from the temple!

673
00:20:56,714 --> 00:21:02,929
You, Rainbow Dash, are AWESOME.

674
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,557
Well. I'm not the one

675
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,557
who can locate a treasure

676
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,309
in half the time Daring Do can.

677
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,311
You may have terrible

678
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,311
taste in books,

679
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,356
but you're pretty

680
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,356
awesome yourself.

681
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,568
In a brainy egghead puzzle-

682
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,568
solving kind of way.

683
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,696
I guess we don't have to agree

684
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,696
on everything to get along.

685
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:21,822
Friends?

686
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,449
DEFINITELY friends.

687
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,954
Do you think AK

688
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,954
Yearling would consider

689
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,329
letting ME write the next book?

690
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,832
I mean, think I could

691
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,832
make things way clearer.

692
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,918
<i>I mean for instance, in</i>

693
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,918
<i>the second adventure</i>

694
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,211
<i>there's a side</i>

697
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,171
<i>of name it right now,</i>

698
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,715
<i>because it's sort of this thing</i>

699
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,715
<i>that I've already written</i>

700
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,342
<i>a lot of fan fiction on I</i>

701
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,342
<i>don't want, you know... not</i>

702
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,342
<i>that I'm saying that you</i>

703
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,342
<i>would steal it.</i>

704
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,971
<i>But I am saying that this</i>

705
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,971
<i>would totally go along</i>

706
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,056
<i>my whole thing about</i>

707
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:47,056
<i>puzzle solving.</i>

708
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,349
<i>Except what if each</i>

709
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:49,349
<i>puzzle that was solved</i>

710
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,351
<i>unlocked a new karate move?</i>

711
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,812
<i>Think of it that way, right?</i>

712
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,605
<i>I'm kind of a Yearlite myself,</i>

713
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,356
<i>so I'm sure she'd be open to--</i>

714
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:58,276
<i>Rainbow Dash: Uh, Quibble?</i>

715
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:58,985
<i>Sorry!</i>
