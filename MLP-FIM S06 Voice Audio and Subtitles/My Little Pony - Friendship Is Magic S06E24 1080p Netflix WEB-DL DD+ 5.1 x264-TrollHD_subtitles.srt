for the Wonderbolt Academy!

60
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,163
You'll be judged on your

00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,163
speed, strength, agility

62
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,793

00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:05,793
in a final evaluation.

That has only happened once.

00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,391
I mean, wings can't

really fall off, can they?

You think you've got what it

74
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,185
takes to be an elite flyer?

Not really. But it's

not my job to worry

103
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,992
about their relationships. I'm

00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,417
use some work, though.

109
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,711
You should tell them.

00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,388
There are solo trials?

196
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,391
Yup. It's a part of

197
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,391
your final evaluation.

198
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,353
We'll ace that test with our

199
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:54,353
wings tied behind our flanks.

200
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,815
My picture will go

201
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,815
right up there,

202
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,942
next to yours.

203
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:03,322
That's a mighty big claim

204
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:03,322
considering everypony here is an

205
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,407
"amazingly awesome

206
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,407
crazy good flyer."

207
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,826
I know.

208
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,246
[ahem] OK! Let's

209
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,246
get back on track.

210
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,248
Now, who can tell me

211
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,248
the best wing angle

212
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,458
to achieve minimal

213
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,458
air resistance?

214
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:20,421
[snoring ]

215
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,756
[blast]

216
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,884
Wake up, newbies!

217
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,884
Class is in session.

218
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,100
[chattering]

219
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,476
Well, there were a

220
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,476
few hiccups,

221
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,436
but overall that

222
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,436
went pretty well.

223
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,105
[noisy yawn]

224
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:39,858
Yeah. Nopony fell asleep.

225
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,236
What? I'm not

226
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,236
a student!

227
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,486
Hey, teach!

228
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,573
Me? Or Twilight?

229
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,573
Probably Twilight.

230
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,243
Uh, both. About

231
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,243
the solo test,

232
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,119
I'm actually kinda

233
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,119
worried about it.

234
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,453
Aw. That's all right.

235
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,040
We all have moments

236
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:55,040
where we doubt ourselves.

237
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:59,294
No. No. I have absolutely

238
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:59,294
zero doubts about myself.

239
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:03,464
I'm a strong flyer, like

240
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:03,464
really, really, really strong.

241
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,301
But this isn't about me.

242
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,301
I'm worried for Vapor.

243
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,680
Oh. Well... that is

244
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:10,680
very... kind? Of you.

245
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,892
Tell you what. It's almost

246
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,892
time for freestyle training.

247
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,270
Why don't you grab her and

248
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,270
show us what you've got?

249
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,940
Yes! Prepare to be

250
00:07:16,311 --> 00:07:19,940
impressed. By me.

251
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,984
Like I said, Vapor

252
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:22,984
still needs work.

253
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,035
Well, he may be full of

254
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,035
himself but I have to admit,

255
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:36,206
Sky's an excellent flyer. He

256
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:36,206
must've shot up 200 feet!

257
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:40,294
But did you see Vapor Trail?

258
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:40,294
Her wing was under his.

259
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:42,545
I think she gave him a boost.

260
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,631
I guess I didn't

261
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,631
even notice Vapor.

262
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,425
I was too busy

263
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,425
watching Sky.

264
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,263
Twilight: [gasp] I

265
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,263
think you're right!

266
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,640
Vapor just created a gust of

267
00:07:51,305 --> 00:07:53,640
wind that caught Sky's wing

268
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,727
at a 45 degree angle, propelling

269
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:57,727
him into a flipping loop.

270
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,563
Somepony paid

271
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,563
attention in class!

272
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,025
Sky obviously has no

273
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,025
idea he's not actually

274
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,320
"amazingly awesome".

275
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,529
And Vapor's so busy making

276
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,529
her friend look good,

277
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,366
she's not focused on

278
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,366
her own flying at all.

279
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,534
This must be our

280
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,534
friendship problem,

281
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,620
and there's only

282
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,620
one thing to do.

283
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,290
Fix it without

284
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,290
telling them!

285
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,290
Tell them

286
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:18,290
the truth!

287
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,338
You don't want

288
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,338
to tell them?

289
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,548
Of course not. Flying

290
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:27,548
is like 30 percent skill

291
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,259
and 70 percent confidence.

292
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,594
You can't mess with

293
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,594
a flier's confidence.

294
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,264
But you can't improve if you

295
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,264
don't think you have to!

296
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,017
Besides, Vapor's keeping a

297
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,017
pretty big secret from Sky

298
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,768
and that can lead

299
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,768
to trouble.

300
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,812
Yeah, but if we tell

301
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,812
them that they've been

302
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,564
holding each other back,

303
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,564
that could be trouble too!

304
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,942
I nailed that

305
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,942
flipping loop.

306
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,986
I'm actually surprised

307
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,986
you're still here;

308
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,113
I thought I blew

309
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:50,113
you away.

310
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:54,575
You were [PANT]

311
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:54,575
great, Sky. [PANT]

312
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,119
Come on, Vapor Trail.

313
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,079
You're going to have to

314
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,079
build up your endurance

315
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,040
if you want a shot

316
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,040
at the Academy.

317
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,917
Wonderbolts don't

318
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,917
get winded.

319
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,046
Angel Wings! You call

320
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:06,046
that cloud busting?

321
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,216
That cloud barely

322
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,216
knew you were there!

323
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:11,592
I love my job.

324
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,803
We'll keep working

325
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,803
and who knows?

326
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,849
One day you might come close

327
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:17,849
to being almost as good as me.

328
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,976
Oh, I don't think so.

329
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,522
You were voted Stratusberg's

330
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:23,522
Most Promising Flier.

331
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,982
I was voted

00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,982
Best Sneeze.

333
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:27,025
Achoo!

334
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,277
You do have a

335
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,277
really great sneeze.

336
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,072
Thanks, Sky. But I don't

337
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:32,072
think I can sneeze my way

338
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,992
into the Academy.

339
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,992
[sigh] I'm pretty beat.

340
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,577
I'm gonna hit the showers.

341
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,456
You have to help her.

342
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,623
Actually, she's

343
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:42,623
not the one--

344
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,292
Will do!

a really strong flyer.

Me?

349
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,887
Vapor Trail, we know

350
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:55,887
what you've been doing.

351
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,640
You've been doing... great!

352
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:02,436
You've been helping Sky.

353
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,563
Uh. I don't know what

354
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,563
you're talking about.

355
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,190
Sky doesn't need anypony's

356
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,190
help. He's amazing.

357
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,862
Not without you. And it's

358
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,862
gonna be pretty obvious

359
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,948
during the solo trials when

360
00:10:12,904 --> 00:10:14,948
he can't get enough air

361
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:16,657
to do a flipping loop.

362
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,910
Oh no. I can't let

363
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,910
that happen.

364
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:21,955
I mean...aww, sugarcubes!

365
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,957
Why are you doing

366
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,957
this for him?

367
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:29,087
[sigh] It started when we were

368
00:10:23,998 --> 00:10:29,087
kids. You have to understand...

369
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,007
Sky grew up with a lot

370
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,007
of siblings. It was tough.

371
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,428
He was always trying to

372
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:36,428
get his parents' attention.

373
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,680
Meanwhile, I was an only child

374
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,680
who hated all the attention

375
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,475
I got from mine.

376
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:45,686
[Mom] Vapor Trail! Where are

377
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:45,686
you? Do you need a snack?

378
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,439
Do you want to do homework?

379
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,566
[Dad] Or we can just spend

380
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,566
some time together!

381
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,777
All day is never enough!

382
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,697
Mom! Dad! Up here! Look, look,

383
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,697
look, look, look, look, hey!

384
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,326
Mom! Dad! Can you see?

385
00:11:09,544 --> 00:11:10,753
[sigh]

386
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,797
That was amazing!

387
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,225
Flying together gave

388
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:24,225
us both what we wanted.

389
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:28,729
But I never told Sky how

390
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:28,729
much I was helping him.

391
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,815
It started with a

392
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,815
small boost here

393
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,984
or a little gust of

394
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:32,984
wind there.

395
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,737
But I didn't think my help could

396
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,737
actually hurt his chances!

397
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,824
I understand. But now

398
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,824
you're both in trouble.

399
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,742
You need to work

400
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:41,742
on your tricks.

401
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,997
And Sky needs to be able to fly

402
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:45,997
without you or he won't make it.

403
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,209
Oh, but he has to! Flying

404
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,209
with the Wonderbolts

405
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,504
has been Sky's dream

406
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:52,504
ever since he was a colt!

407
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,047
What about you?

408
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,883
I-I guess I haven't

409
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,883
thought about it.

410
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,010
I just want to be

411
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,010
with my best friend.

412
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,762
Then we have to find a

413
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,762
way to help both of you.

414
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,764
Starting with telling

415
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,764
Sky the truth.

416
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,976
No! You can't. Sky

417
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:06,976
will be crushed.

418
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,728
And without his confidence

419
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,728
he won't fly as well.

420
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,359
[sigh] Then I guess we'll

421
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:14,359
give Dash's method a shot.

422
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:19,447
Yes! I love being right.

423
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:19,447
OK. Here's what we do.

424
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,741
Sky needs to build his strength.

425
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,741
Air drills, wing lifts...

426
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,578

427
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,578

But how will we

431
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,789

432
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,791
He doesn't think

433
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:30,791
he needs practice.

434
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,337
We'll just tell Sky that he

435
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,337
should practice with Twilight
