Well, Snails, with

Yeah. If you're not

you two are really good

260
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,831
at this game and if it

261
00:08:15,162 --> 00:08:17,831
means beating Appleoosa,

262
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,334

Honestly, the game was

281
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,360
a little scary at first,

282
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,737
but once I got the hang of

283
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:49,737

284
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:53,116
Let's get this

286

294
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:12,802

580
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,237
you to win,

581
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,198
but not if worrying about

582
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,198
it makes you miserable.

583
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,660
Winning's never worth that.

584
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,788
But how do we keep

585
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,788
from worrying about it?

586
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,083
You could do what I do

587
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:27,083
and not think about it.

588
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:31,211
Seriously, I don't think

589
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:31,211
about anything. Ever.

590
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,047
Hmm, works for me!

591
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:39,762
[roaring cheer]

592
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,806
[Announcer] And with another

593
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:41,806
bouncing goal from Pinkie Pie,

594
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:43,182
<i>the score is tied!</i>

595
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,895
You guys are amazing!

596
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,148
Braeburn is really good!

597
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,943
So is that Pegasus. Oh I

598
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:53,943
don't know if we can win.

599
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:55,903
You know what I would do...

600
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:58,698
Not think about it?

601
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,907
not think--

602
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,245
Oh. Yeah. That.

603
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,247
And as long as

604
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,247
you're having fun,

605
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,208
it doesn't matter

606
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,208
if you win or not.

607
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,170
[whistle tweets]

608
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,757
Hee-hee! I think it's

609
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,757
more fun this way.

610
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:23,263
<i>And Pinkie wins the buckoff.</i>

611
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:23,263
<i>But her shot's rejected!</i>

612
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,266
<i>Back to Braeburn, whose</i>

613
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,266
<i>kick's stopped by another</i>

614
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:30,146
<i>Fluttershy save.</i>

615
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:30,146
<i>Next point wins.</i>

616
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,398
<i>Lots of tense back</i>

617
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,398
<i>and forth here.</i>

618
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,275
<i>Fluttershy unleashes</i>

619
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:35,275
<i>her patented spin move.</i>

620
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,028
<i>But Braeburn's there to-</i>

621
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,198
<i>NO! It's Pinkie with</i>

622
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,198
<i>a somersault kick.</i>

623
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:45,203
<i>What a move! And that's</i>

624
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:45,203
<i>the game! Ponyville wins!</i>

625
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:50,416
PONY-VILLE! PONY-VILLE!

626
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:50,416
PONY-VILLE! PONY-VILLE!

627
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:54,545
PONY-VILLE! PONY-VILLE!

628
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,299
Looks like you three

629
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,299
made quite an impression.

630
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,053
Well, cousin, I

631
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,053
have to admit,

632
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,889
your Ponyville team

633
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,889
played a pretty good game.

634
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:10,061
Ha! Good game? We bucked the

635
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:10,061
hooves right off of you.

636
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,312
Yep. You sure as shootin' did.

637
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,941
I'm gonna have to get real

638
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,941
serious about a strategy

639
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,026
for our rematch.

640
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:19,361
Oh, I wouldn't get too serious.

641
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,865
Yeah. Everypony knows the

642
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,865
secret to good Buckball

643
00:21:22,907 --> 00:21:25,325
is just having fun!

644
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,955
