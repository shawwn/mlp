00:05:40,917 --> 00:05:43,041
it's only an hour,

196
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,667
I'm sure everything

197
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:45,667
will be just fine.

198
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:50,792
Exactly. Now, kindly step

199
00:05:45,709 --> 00:05:50,792
this way. Relaxation awaits.

200
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,417
[gasp] Rainbow Dash?

201
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,417
What are you doing here?

202
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,625
[giggle]

203
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,667
Yeah. I didn't think

204
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:04,667
spa treatments

205
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:06,333
were your thing exactly.

206
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:07,583
What?

207
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:12,250
Oh. They're totally not.

208
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,333
At least, not the

209
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,333
"frou-frou" kind.

210
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,750
Ah.

211
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,750
Yeah, I-uh, I think

212
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,750
I tweaked something

213
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,959
at Wonderbolts practice

214
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:20,959
the other day.

215
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,625
I just came in for a deep

216
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,625
tissue sports massage.

217
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,750
Ah, Miss Dash? I

218
00:06:24,667 --> 00:06:26,750
am so sorry,

219
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:29,458
but we are running

220
00:06:26,792 --> 00:06:29,458
just a tad behind

221
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,583
and we're not quite

222
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,583
ready to start your

223
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,875
pampered muzzle massage and

224
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:35,875
indulgent hooficure just yet.

225
00:06:38,709 --> 00:06:41,250
Oh. [nervous laugh]

226
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,917
I-I'm pretty sure that

227
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:43,917
wasn't what I signed up for.

228
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,583
But they are your usuals-

229
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,125
And it seems like you're

230
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:50,125
really busy today anyway.

231
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,750
I'll just come back tomorrow.

232
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,917
Uh, see you two

233
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,917
later. Have fun.

234
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,041
But put me down for

235
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:56,041
the same thing.

236
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,166
[chuckle] Too bad Rainbow

237
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:03,166
Dash just "hates" those

238
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:05,333
"frou-frou" spa treatments.

239
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,333
She could have joined

240
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,333
us for a nice steam.

241
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,208
Whoo wee! I can't wait.

242
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,083
[giggle] Indeed. Although if

243
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:13,083
they couldn't fit Dashie in,

244
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,417
I wonder just how far

245
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,417
behind things are running.

246
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,583
Obviously we're on a

247
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:17,583
very tight schedule.

248
00:07:20,625 --> 00:07:22,000
[grunt] [gasp]

249
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,166
Well, maybe not everypony is

250
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,166
waiting for the steam room.

251
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,333
Oh, no, no, that's exactly

252
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:34,333
what we're waiting for.

253
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,208
Oh, I hope you're

254
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,208
not in a hurry.

255
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,667
So every pony here

256
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:44,667
wants a steam bath?

257
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:48,083
[all talking

258
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:48,083
affirmatively at once]

259
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,917
Well, the solution

260
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,917
is obvious.

261
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,166
We'll simply have to start

262
00:07:49,959 --> 00:07:52,166
our short time at the spa

263
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:53,458
with something else.

264
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,208
Huh! Nothin' doin'! I

265
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,208
came here to have a steam

266
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,041
and that's just

267
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,041
what I'm gonna get.

268
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,125
But-but it will take

269
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,125
most of our hour

270
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,083
just to get through

271
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,083
this line.

272
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:08,458
Rarity! My favorite

274
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,792
And Appleyack!

275
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:14,458
Well, it certainly has been

276
00:08:11,834 --> 00:08:14,458
a long time since you two

277
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,041
were here together. So

278
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,041
lovely to have you back.

279
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,083
Well, I wish I

280
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:21,083
could say the same.

281
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,667
Yes, the wait time

282
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,667
for the steam room

283
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,500
certainly has been

284
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:26,500
getting worse lately.

285
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:29,333
But I'm sure we'll be

286
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:29,333
able to accommodate

287
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,250
your usual treatments.

288
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:33,166
Not without my steam.

289
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,333
Apparently Applejack won't

290
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:35,333
consider starting her time

291
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,417
at the spa without a steam

292
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:38,417
and we only have an hour.

293
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,458
That is a problem.

294
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,208
Applejack, where are you going?

295
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,500
Um... Why are y'all

296
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,500
just standing here?

297
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:50,750
Ugh! Just waiting for

298
00:08:47,542 --> 00:08:50,750
the steam to build up.

299
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,667
Without steam, a steam

300
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:53,667
room's just a room

301
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,875
and I've got plenty

302
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:55,875
of those at home...

303
00:08:55,917 --> 00:08:57,709
because I live in a mansion.

304
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,959
It has been taking longer

305
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,959
for the steam to reach that

306
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,917
"Ponyville Day Spa" quality.

307
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,959
We even had to add a

308
00:09:11,959 --> 00:09:15,959
warm towel service.

309
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,542
So sorry for the

310
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,542
delay, everypony,

311
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:20,166
please help yourselves.

312
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,542
So, if you're not

313
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:31,542
getting enough steam,

314
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,500
that must mean there's

315
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,500
not enough hot water.

316
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:35,917
Oh Applejack, honestly,

317
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,750
can't we just start

318
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:37,750
with a hooficure?

319
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,417
We're going to

320
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:39,417
run out of time!

321
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:48,959
Hmmm.

323
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,458
Ha! Now, what do we have here?

324
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,333
The laundry room, of course.

325
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,375
And at this point, I'm

326
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,375
considering soaking my hooves

327
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:18,166
in one of the machines so my

328
00:10:15,417 --> 00:10:18,166
time here isn't a total loss.

329
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:22,542
The Ponyville Day Spa prides

330
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:22,542
itself on sanitary conditions

331
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,375
and fresh linens

332
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,375
are integral part.

333
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,834
Well, sure, but have you

334
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,834
always run every single one

335
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,875
of these here machines

336
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,875
full-bore, all day, every day?

337
00:10:31,917 --> 00:10:33,959
The answer is no...

338
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,291
but ponies sure do love

339
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,291
their warm towel service.

340
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:46,959
Hmmm.

341
00:11:01,834 --> 00:11:03,834
You are all wanting towel?

342
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,000
Looks to me like you

343
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:06,000
don't have any left.

344
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,417
Well, like I said. Warm

345
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,417
towels are big hit.

346
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,291
I think I figured

347
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,291
out the problem.

348
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,750
You've got a small leak

349
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:27,750
and that means the steam

350
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,125
takes just a little

351
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,125
longer to build up

352
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,959
and while ponies wait,

353
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,959
they get cold.

354
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,166
Cold ponies start wrapping

355
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,166
themselves in towels...

356
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,500
and all those dirty

357
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:39,500
towels have to be cleaned...

358
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,667
because Ponyville Day Spa

359
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,667
prides itself on cleanliness.

360
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,125
Eh. What?

361
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,083
Basically, losing steam

362
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:53,083
makes you use more towels.

363
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,709
That means you do more laundry

364
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,709
which uses up the hot water

365
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,667
you need to make more

366
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,667
steam so the problem

367
00:11:57,709 --> 00:12:00,000
just keeps getting worse.

368
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,500
Oh.That makes sense. I see.

369
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:05,333
Ah! I had no idea.

370
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,709
Wonderful!

00:13:01,583 --> 00:13:04,667
and without all that laundry,

388
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,834
there'll be plenty of hot

389
00:13:04,709 --> 00:13:06,834
water for all the steam

390
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:09,750
anypony could want.

391
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:12,875
And I'll only have to be

392
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:12,875
doing wash once a day!

393
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,834
Wow, Appleyack. Have you ever

394
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:18,834
considered a career

395
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:23,125
in the spa industry? I'm sure

396
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:23,125
I can find something for you.

397
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:27,250
[laugh] No thanks. I'm just

398
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:27,250
relieved I can finally relax

399
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,041
in the steam. What do

400
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:30,041
you say, Rarity?

401
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,667
Mmm. It sounds lovely,

402
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,667
Applejack,

403
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:34,583
but unfortunately...

404
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,750
you spent so much time

405
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:36,750
fixing the steam room

406
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,792
we don't have any time

407
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,792
left to use it.

408
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,625
Honestly, how in Equestria

409
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:41,625
did it never occur to you

410
00:13:41,667 --> 00:13:43,458
to check for leaks?

411
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,667
There's just so many other

412
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,667
things to worry about.

413
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,208
I suppose we get used

414
00:13:46,709 --> 00:13:49,208
to the way things are

415
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,792
and we don't realize

416
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,792
there was problem.

417
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:55,625
You obviously need an outside

418
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:55,625
eye to evaluate the situation.

419
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,166
It's lucky for you Applejack

420
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:59,166
is too stubborn to relax.

421
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,709
Uh, I'm sorry, Rarity.

422
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,792
We'll just have to

423
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,792
do this another day.

424
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,208
Twilight and Spike should be

425
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,208
done feeding the pigs by now.

426
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,041
Twilight is a very capable pony.

427
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,792
I'm sure she can figure

428
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:11,792
out what to do next.

429
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:15,041
Look, I know Twilight's a

430
00:14:11,834 --> 00:14:15,041
princess and an alicorn,

431
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,750
but she isn't a farmer.

432
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,917
I've been doing farm work my

433
00:14:16,792 --> 00:14:19,917
whole life and I'm not sure

434
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,166
it's something you

435
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,166
can just figure out.

436
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,625
Of course. [gasp] Why don't

437
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:26,625
we pop back so you can explain

438
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,166
to Twilight what to do next

439
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:29,166
and then we'll come back here

440
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,041
and pick up where we left off?

441
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,250
Well, I suppose I could try,

442
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,667
assuming everything

443
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,667
went well so far.

444
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,083
Oh, Applejack, honestly!

445
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,083
[chuckle] How could it not?

446
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,417
Wouldn't it be

447
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,417
easier to just fly?

448
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,333
I told you, Spike, we're

449
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,333
following Applejack's list

450
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:56,750
to the letter and Applejack

451
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:56,750
doesn't fly-- [grunt]

452
00:14:56,792 --> 00:14:57,667
Aaaaah!

453
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,333
Whoa!

454
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,083
[groan]

455
00:15:07,208 --> 00:15:09,166
I'm sorry, Rarity,

456
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,542
but I think I'm gonna have to

457
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:12,542
finish these chores myself.

458
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,667
[growl]

459
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,458
Twilight, darling, how in the

460
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:22,458
world did you end up there?

461
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,083
Spike and I were just trying

462
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,083
to follow Applejack's list

463
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,625
as closely as possible.

464
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:29,542
Mmm...maybe not the best plan.

465
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,834
I'm sorry, Applejack.

466
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,458
But we never even got

467
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:34,458
started feeding the pigs.

468
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,125
That's all right, Twilight.

469
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,125
I know you did your best.

470
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,083
I guess a list can't really

471
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:41,083
capture all the ways I have

472
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:42,667
of doin' things.

473
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,542
At least you two got to spend

474
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:45,542
some time at the spa together.

475
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,208
Yeah, that must have

476
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:48,208
been super relaxing.

477
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,750
Well, if watching

478
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:50,750
Applejack fix plumbing

479
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:53,583
counts as relaxing, then yes.

480
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,792
What about your hour

481
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,792
of spa perfection?

482
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:59,625
As it turns out, the Ponyville

483
00:15:55,834 --> 00:15:59,625
Day Spa had a few problems

484
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,208
with their steam room and

485
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:03,208
somepony refused to relax

486
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,834
until she had fixed them.

487
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,125
I'm sorry, but I just

488
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,125
couldn't let those spa ponies

489
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,917
go another minute putting

490
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:10,917
up with problems

491
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,834
they didn't even know they had.

492
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,250
Somehow they just got used to

493
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,250
a huge bottleneck of ponies

494
00:16:17,291 --> 00:16:19,375
standin' around waitin'.

495
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:21,458
But I took one good

496
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:21,458
look at that spa-jam

497
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,750
and I knew I had

498
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,750
to do something.

499
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,208
Sometimes the simplest

500
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:26,208
things can just derail

501
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,375
a whole operation.

502
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:30,166
[funny mouth noises]

503
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,875
Whether it's a leaky pipe

504
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,875
or doing too much laundry,

505
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:35,417
you can't just stick to the

506
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:35,417
same old way of doing things

507
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:37,166
and expect them to get better.

508
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:41,750
[Chicken noises]

509
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:46,750
I mean, thinking you can is

510
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:46,750
just plum ridiculous, right?

511
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:50,041
[chuckle] It's funny when

512
00:16:46,792 --> 00:16:50,041
you realize the extra work

513
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,709
they were doing was actually

514
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,709
making things worse.

515
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,625
I mean, I guess it's possible

516
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,625
to get stuck in a routine

517
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,125
where you're doing all

518
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,125
this extra stuff

519
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,375
and not realize it,

520
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:12,250
but I can't for the life

521
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:12,250
of me think of how.

522
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,291
Why are y'all starin'

523
00:17:12,291 --> 00:17:14,291
at me like that?

524
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,166
Um, are you certain

525
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:19,166
everything you just did

526
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,083
is entirely necessary

527
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:22,083
to feed the pigs?

528
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:27,083
What? Of course! Why would

529
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:27,083
I be doin' it if it weren't?

530
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,166
See this gate here used

531
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:29,166
to squeak so loud,

532
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,417
the pigs would run to the

533
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:31,417
other side of the pen

534
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:32,750
and never come out,

535
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:35,250
so I open and close it to

536
00:17:32,792 --> 00:17:35,250
let them know it's safe.

537
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,041
But it doesn't squeak anymore.

538
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,834
Of course not. I

539
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:40,834
fixed that ages ago.

540
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,834
Then I realized putting a

541
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:43,834
little fright into 'em

542
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,166
got them all hustlin'

543
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,166
out of the pen.

544
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,792
They don't look

545
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,792
scared to me.

546
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,041
Well, no, they got

547
00:17:48,834 --> 00:17:51,041
used to it.

548
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:55,667
Which is why I started doing

549
00:17:52,417 --> 00:17:55,667
the chicken dance to show 'em

550
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,542
that if they didn't get to

551
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:57,542
eatin' their food,

552
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:00,125
the chickens would.

553
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,625
Of course, being a chicken,

554
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,208
I couldn't very

555
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,208
well open the gate.

556
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,125
Getting the food bucket to

557
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,125
spill into the trough

558
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,750
was just a happy accident

559
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,625
because one time I left

560
00:18:07,792 --> 00:18:10,625
it there by mistake.

561
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:13,667
Uh Applejack, it seems like

562
00:18:10,667 --> 00:18:13,667
everything you're doing

563
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,291
is to fix things that aren't

564
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:16,291
really problems anymore.

565
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:21,000
Well, I'll be.

566
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:23,250

doing that around here

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,667
to doing everything

578
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,667
a certain way,

579
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:07,208
I didn't realize there

580
00:20:04,709 --> 00:20:07,208
were any problems.

581
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,000
Having a friend look

582
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:09,000
at what you're doing

583
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,417
with an outside eye

584
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,417
can really help.

585
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,417
Um-hm. And I suppose

586
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,417
if it weren't for our

587
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,333
unsuccessful time at the spa,

588
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,667
none of us would

589
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,667
have realized it.

590
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:20,375
Well, now that your

591
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:20,375
chores are streamlined,

592
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,667
what are you going to do

593
00:20:20,417 --> 00:20:22,667
with all the extra time?

594
00:20:22,709 --> 00:20:25,250
I think I have a few ideas.

595
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,083
[sigh] Think you can come

596
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:28,083
up with enough things

597
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,041
for us to do now that we have

598
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:31,041
more time to relax?

599
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,625
Oh please, I could plan a

600
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,625
week's worth of treatments.

601
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,375
Huh. Well, let's

602
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,375
just start with the

603
00:20:36,417 --> 00:20:38,000
rest of the day for now.

604
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,208
After all the work we

605
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:40,208
just did on the farm,

606
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,125
I am ready for some

607
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:43,125
serious relaxation.

608
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,583
[sigh] Thanks for letting me

609
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:46,583
know there was an opening.

610
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,959
I don't know if I could

611
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:48,959
make it without my

612
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,250
pampered muzzle massage.

613
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,875
Don't worry about it.

614
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,417
Shall I put you down for

615
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:54,417
another one tomorrow?

616
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,583
Oh, absolutely.

617
00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:00,041
Sometimes a girl just has to

618
00:20:56,625 --> 00:21:00,041
pamper herself, am I right?

619
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,083
<i>Rarity: You</i>

620
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,083
<i>certainly are.</i>

621
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:07,667
[gasp] Oh. Oh! Hey! I

622
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:07,667
was just, uh, uh...

623
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:12,625
Getting a "sports"

624
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:12,625
pamperin'? [chuckle]

625
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,083
[giggle] Don't

626
00:21:12,667 --> 00:21:14,083
worry, Rainbow Dash.

627
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,458
We were just heading in for

628
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:16,458
some pampering ourselves.

629
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,375
You could always join us.

630
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,375
That is if you don't mind

631
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,375
suffering through

632
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,959
one or two "frou-frou"

633
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,959
treatments.

634
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Ah, I suppose I could take

635
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,000
it. You know, for you ponies.

636
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:31,291
[giggle]

637
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,333
Applejack: Busted!
