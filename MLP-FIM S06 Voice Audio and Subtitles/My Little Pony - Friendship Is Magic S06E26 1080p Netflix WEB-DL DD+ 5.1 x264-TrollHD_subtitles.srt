revenge. You don't have to.

579
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,763
You can be the leader

580
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,763
your subjects deserve.

581
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,982
There is no revenge you

582
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,982
could ever conceive of

583
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,317
that will come close to

584
00:19:09,023 --> 00:19:11,317
what I will exact upon you

585
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,445
one day, Starlight Glimmer!

586
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,456
Thorax, as the new leader

587
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,456
of the Changelings,

588
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,793
I look forward to discussing how

589
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:28,793
we can improve our relationship

590
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,544
in the future.

591
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,255
However, for the moment,

592
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:33,255
perhaps it is best

593
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,677
that we leave the Changeling

594
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,677
Kingdom to the Changelings.

595
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,928
[poof]

596
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,221
Splendid idea!

597
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,221
Now who's ready

598
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,225
for some celebratory

599
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:45,225
tea at Fluttershy's?

600
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:48,437
Oh. Um. Everypony?

601
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,231
Actually, now that you

602
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:51,231
can snap your claws

603
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,233
and send us absolutely

604
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,233
anywhere again,

605
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,194
I think I have a

606
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,194
better option.

607
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:02,242
Uh.. Hey Starlight.

608
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:02,242
What are you doing here?

609
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,411
You left in such

610
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:04,411
a hurry before,

611
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,123
we kinda thought you

612
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,123
didn't want to come.

613
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:10,751
Yeah. I guess after the way I

614
00:20:07,165 --> 00:20:10,751
used my magic on all of you,

615
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,379
I wasn't sure I was somepony

616
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,379
who should even be in charge

617
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,382
of a baking contest. I was

618
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,382
afraid I might go back

619
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,719
to being the pony I

620
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:19,719
used to be. But...

621
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,763
I realized that sometimes

622
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,763
you don't have a choice.

623
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:27,852
You have to step up. And I

624
00:20:22,805 --> 00:20:27,852
HAVE changed. I can handle it.

625
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,604
Whether than means saving

626
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:30,604
Equestria OR helping friends

627
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,358
with a sunset festival.

628
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:34,358
Speaking of which...

629
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,278
I know the festival is almost

630
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,278
over, but I kinda invited

631
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,280
a few of my

632
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,280
friends to join.

633
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,952
Hope that's OK.

634
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,580
Are you kidding? Of course!

635
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,125
Great. Now, where's

636
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:51,125
that baking contest?

637
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,252
This pony needs a cupcake!

638
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,760
So I'm able to rip the very

639
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,760
fabric of reality again.

640
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,429
Yeah, yeah and I'm

641
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,429
still a self-absorbed,

642
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,224
below-average

643
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,224
illusionist. Right?

644
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,185
Actually, I was going to say

645
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,185
a COUPLE of those illusions

646
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,520
were slightly above average.

647
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:15,315
If you ever need a little chaos

648
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:15,315
in your act, let me know.

649
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,986
Ha! When pigs fly!

650
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,447
Your wish is my command!

651
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,157
[snap]

652
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,324
[squeal]

653
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,119
Whoa-whoaaaa!

654
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,832
Somepony is really gonna have to

655
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:31,832
catch us up on what we missed.
