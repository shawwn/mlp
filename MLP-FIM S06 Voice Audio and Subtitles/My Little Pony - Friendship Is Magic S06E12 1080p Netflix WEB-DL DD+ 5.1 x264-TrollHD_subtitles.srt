Oh! Me? Oh, I'm

197
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,458
fine. Thank you.

198
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:33,417
No rating.

199
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,667
[sigh] [Mumbling]

200
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,667
Anyway they won't come.

201
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:39,458
Hiya! What's your name?

202
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,291
Coriander Cumin.

203
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,792
Are you a chef here, too?

204
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,375
My daughter cooks. I host.

205
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:47,500
Then why are you

206
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:47,500
stacking chairs?

207
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:52,917
Without customers, I have no

208
00:05:47,542 --> 00:05:52,917
pony to host for. So, I stack.

209
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,333
Father! STOP IT!

210
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,375
Don't close up the restaurant

211
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:57,375
around our guests!

212
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,500
What does it matter?

213
00:05:57,417 --> 00:05:59,500
When they leave,

214
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,917
nopony else will

215
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,917
be coming in!

216
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,500
Well, your attitude isn't

217
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:05,500
going to bring anyone in!

218
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:08,458
Can't you at least

219
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:08,458
pretend to be positive?

220
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,041
[slurp] Sooooooo

221
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:13,041
goooooood! [gobbles]

222
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,083
Father: You are doing enough

223
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:16,083
pretending for the both of us.

224
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,917
Nopony here wants

225
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,917
to try anything new.

226
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,500
I know when to

227
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:22,500
throw in the towel!

228
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:25,500
Um. Pinkie, perhaps we

229
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:25,500
should excuse ourselves.

230
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:29,333
[chews] Oh Rarity,

231
00:06:25,542 --> 00:06:29,333
try this!

232
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,500
[gulps] Oooh!

233
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,709
Maybe if you would listen

234
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:35,709
to my ideas for once--

235
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,166
Oh yes, I did not move

236
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,166
halfway across Equestria

237
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,750
for my daughter that

238
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,750
I NEVER listen to!

239
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,875
Rarity. I think that

240
00:06:42,792 --> 00:06:44,875
friendship problem

241
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,458
just KABLAMMED us

242
00:06:44,917 --> 00:06:47,458
right between the eyes.

243
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,750
These two? Oh I

244
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,750
don't know, darling.

245
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:53,750
The food IS excellent, but

246
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:53,750
I'm not sure there's much

247
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:56,500
you and I can do

248
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:56,500
to help them.

249
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,667
What would you

250
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,667
have me do?

251
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,500
We can't even get

252
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,500
Zesty Gourmand

253
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:00,750
to come to our

254
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:00,750
restaurant!

255
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,750
She took one look

256
00:07:00,792 --> 00:07:02,750
at how empty it was

257
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,083
and said it wasn't

258
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:05,083
even worth rating!

259
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:06,375
THAT'S IT!

260
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:09,542
YES! Uh, what's it?

261
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,709
The flow HAS led us here!

262
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:12,709
THIS is our mission!

263
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,166
We are going to get

264
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,166
you a Three Hoof rating

265
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:19,709
and save your restaurant! I

266
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:19,709
can get Zesty Gourmand here.

267
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,583
[gasp] And I can pack

268
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,583
this place with ponies!

269
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,583
Hmph! And how do you

270
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:25,583
intend to do such a thing?

271
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,625
Just leave it to us!

272
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,917
Father, will you PLEASE

273
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:38,917
stop packing things?

274
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,917
When the lovely

275
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,917
pony comes back

276
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,542
and says she couldn't

277
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,542
convince Zesty Gourmand

278
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,625
to come visit us, we will

279
00:07:43,583 --> 00:07:46,625
need to pack all this up.

280
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,625
I'm just getting

281
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,625
a head start.

282
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:51,166
You really don't

283
00:07:48,667 --> 00:07:51,166
know Rarity.

284
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,417
I've done it!

285
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:54,709
See?

286
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,750
It took all of my

287
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,750
charm and cajoling,

288
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:59,417
but I was able to

289
00:07:56,792 --> 00:07:59,417
convince Zesty Gourmand

290
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,792
to come and try the food!

291
00:08:00,834 --> 00:08:03,000
What is the catch?

292
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:07,500
Ah, yes. Well, um, there

293
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:07,500
IS a bit of a challenge.

294
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:10,834
The only time she can make

295
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:10,834
herself available is tonight.

296
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,166
Pfft! Oh yeah, right.

297
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:14,291
What is it?

298
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,417
Zesty rates a restaurant

299
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,417
on cuisine, decor

300
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:20,458
AND presentation. And she

301
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:20,458
has very specific tastes.

302
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,792
If she's coming tonight,

303
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,792
there IS quite a bit of work

304
00:08:22,834 --> 00:08:24,417
that needs to get done.

305
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:25,542
Like what?

306
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,208
Oh a tweak here, a tuck there.

307
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,959
Some slight modifications

308
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,959
to the menu. [chuckle]

309
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,500
We just need the place to

310
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,500
feel more cosmopolitan.

311
00:08:32,542 --> 00:08:34,000
[scoffs]

312
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,000
Father, after Rarity went to

313
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,000
all of this trouble for us,

314
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:39,625
can't we at least try?

315
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,625
Why don't I stay

316
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:41,625
behind with Coriander

317
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,834
to get the restaurant

318
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:43,834
ready for Zesty's arrival.

319
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,583
You and Saffron can try

320
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,583
and drum up some business.

321
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,041
One packed restaurant

322
00:08:46,625 --> 00:08:50,041
coming right up.

323
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,500
Coriander, I understand

324
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:53,500
your trepidation.

325
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,208
But I promise you, we will

326
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,208
get those hooves by making

327
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,625
this place feel just like

328
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:58,625
all of the other restaurants

329
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,667
on Restaurant Row!

330
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,125
[sigh] I hope my father

331
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,125
doesn't drive Rarity crazy.

332
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,625
It'll be fine. Rarity's

333
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:06,625
going to make sure that

334
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,709
The Tasty Treat is the

335
00:09:06,667 --> 00:09:08,709
most unique and beautiful

336
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,458
restaurant in Canterlot!

337
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,834
Not like all those stuffy

412
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,875
and we haven't found

413
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:45,875
anyponies! What will we do?

414
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:49,458
Try harder! FILLIES

415
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:49,458
AND GENTLECOLTS!

416
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,458
Check out the super stupendous

417
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,458
and amazing cuisine

418
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,250
of the Tasty Treat! GRAND

419
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,250
RE-OPENING TONIGHT!

420
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,083
How many Hooves

421
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,083
does it have?

422
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,417
No hooves yet, but

423
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:02,417
hopefully soon!

424
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,875
Well, when it gets

425
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:05,875
rated, let us know!

426
00:12:05,917 --> 00:12:07,792
Ughh! Stupid hooves!

427
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:12,875
Oh, look at this, hon!

428
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:14,458
Oh, The Tasty Treat.

429
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,125
Do you think that's

430
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,125
a restaurant, Sugar?

431
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,667
Yes! Yes it IS!

432
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,750
We came to Canterlot

433
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,750
from Winnieapolis

434
00:12:19,792 --> 00:12:21,291
to be adventurous!

435
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,875
But so far the food in all

436
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,875
these hoity- toity places

437
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:29,000
tastes like somepony cooked up

438
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:29,000
nuthin' with a side of nuthin!

439
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,834
Well, please, come

440
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,834
try The Tasty Treat.

441
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,875
I think it's going

442
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,875
to be exactly

443
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,083
what you're

444
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,083
looking for!

445
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,417
[sigh] This is

446
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,417
going to be exactly

447
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,834
what Zesty is looking for!

448
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,875
[door opens]

449
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:48,250
Father, we're ba-- [gasp]

450
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,291
Rarity. What did

451
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,291
you do?

452
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,333
Welcome to The Tasty Treat.

453
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,917
You can eat here if you

454
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,917
want. Or not. Who cares?

455
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,709
I know! Isn't it perfect?

456
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,709
Zesty is sure to love it!

457
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,041
I thought we were trying to

458
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:03,041
make this the most unique

459
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,917
and beautiful

460
00:13:03,083 --> 00:13:04,917
restaurant in Canterlot.

461
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,125
Not make it exactly like

462
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,125
every other restaurant!

463
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,250
[chuckle] We want

464
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:10,250
to help our friends

465
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,875
by getting them three hooves.

466
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,875
That will only happen

467
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,750
if this IS like every

468
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,750
other restaurant.

469
00:13:16,917 --> 00:13:19,750
Father, what is this?

470
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:23,166
NOT THAT! ANYTHING BUT THAT!

471
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:27,083
This is what we must cook

472
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:27,083
if we want to succeed here!

473
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,333
This isn't what I wanted!

474
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,083
I wanted Canterlot

475
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,083
to like US for US!

476
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,625
Rarity, how could you

477
00:13:33,125 --> 00:13:35,625
ruin the restaurant!

478
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:39,000
Ah! [splutters] We've

479
00:13:35,667 --> 00:13:39,000
helped SAVE the restaurant!

480
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,208
Now where are the

481
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,208
other guests?

482
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,750
How many other

483
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,750
ponies are coming?

484
00:13:43,792 --> 00:13:45,542
Two.

485
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,959
Just TWO? I thought you

486
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:48,959
said you could pack a place

487
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,625
with ponies no matter what!

488
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,542
YOU said you would make

489
00:13:50,667 --> 00:13:52,542
the restaurant better

490
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,000
so I guess we both didn't know

491
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,000
what we were talking about!

492
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:56,166
[knock at door]

493
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,417
[gasp] ZESTY GOURMAND!

494
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:59,417
Everypony! Places!

495
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,834
Welcome to the Tasty Treat.

496
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,417
What can I get you

497
00:14:16,875 --> 00:14:19,417
this evening?

498
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,959
I hardly think it matters.

499
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,792
But by all means, try

500
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,792
your best to impress.

501
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:27,000
Well, we'll both try the

502
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:27,000
special this evening,

503
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,041
maybe with a little

504
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,041
kick to it, eh?

505
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,583
Yeah, we've been craving

506
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:31,583
some food with actual taste.

507
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,166
Saffron Masala!

508
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,166
What are you doing?

509
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:42,041
I'm trying to save

510
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:42,041
our reputations.

511
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,375
I've given it at least

512
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:45,375
a little bit of flavor.

513
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,667
No, no, no, no! But that's

514
00:14:45,417 --> 00:14:47,667
not what Zesty wants!

515
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,625
What kind of food expert

516
00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:50,625
DOESN'T want flavor?

517
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:52,041
That's insane!

518
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,083
I'm taking this out there.

519
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,000
No! Zesty will hate it!

520
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,834
You are going to

521
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:01,834
RUIN this for them!

522
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,542
No! I'm trying to fix

523
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,542
it after YOU ruined it!

524
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:09,500
Nooooooooooo!

525
00:15:09,542 --> 00:15:10,500
[splat]

526
00:15:13,667 --> 00:15:16,083
I think we are done here.

527
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,792
Zesty! Please wait.

528
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:20,792
Allow me to explain.

529
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:24,458
Rarity. When it comes to

530
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:24,458
fashion, you are adequate.

531
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,959
But take some advice

532
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,959
from a friend.

533
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,625
Keep your opinions

534
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,625
out of restaurants.

535
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:33,750
Substandard food, laughable

536
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:33,750
service and I would think

537
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,667
even YOU could recognize

538
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:36,667
that the decor here

539
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:40,875
is trying desperately

540
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:40,875
while desperately failing.

541
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:44,041
Recommending a disreputable

542
00:15:40,917 --> 00:15:44,041
place such as this

543
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,959
could do serious damage

544
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:47,959
to your social standing.

545
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,375
Disreputable?

546
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:52,291
You mean a place with food

547
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:52,291
that actually tastes good?

548
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,709
Anypony can throw

549
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,709
ingredients together

550
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,875
and create an obvious taste

551
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,875
that uncultured ponies

552
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:02,500
like those two can register.

553
00:16:02,542 --> 00:16:03,583
Hey!

554
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,250
But it takes a TRUE

555
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,250
culinary artist

556
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,458
to create a subtle taste.

557
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,625
The barest hint

558
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,625
of a sensation.

559
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:15,709
That's what I bring to

560
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:15,709
Canterlot. That's art.

561
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,083
I'm so embarrassed.

562
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,375
I don't know that there are

563
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,375
words to adequately express

564
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,917
how truly sorry we are.

565
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,750
The worst has happened. No use

566
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:32,750
crying over spilled food now.

567
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,291
Here, this always cheered

568
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:36,291
me up when I was younger.

569
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:40,542
[gasp] My spicy flat

570
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:40,542
noodle soup! [slurps]

571
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:46,166
Mmm! Oh my, this is

572
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:46,166
truly delightful.

573
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,750
This is the best thing

574
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,750

575
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,333
And I thought the food

576
00:16:48,792 --> 00:16:51,333
before was the best!

577
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,125
That's all I've ever

578
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:54,125

like the food we made

582
00:16:56,542 --> 00:17:00,000
together when I was younger.

583
00:17:00,041 --> 00:17:03,625

584

we've cooked together. [laugh]

585
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,959
Remember how you used

586
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,959
to hide the ingredients

587
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
you did not like.

some stuffy unicorn

592
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,375

That's true.

598
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,125
That's double true!

599
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,417
You just need ponies in

600
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:26,417

it was good. They told us.

these ponies what to think.

681
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,333
Zesty, you have very specific--

682

And very strange!

683
00:20:12,542 --> 00:20:15,125
Yes and very strange

your food a certain way,

688
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,125
there is no reason

689
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,125
