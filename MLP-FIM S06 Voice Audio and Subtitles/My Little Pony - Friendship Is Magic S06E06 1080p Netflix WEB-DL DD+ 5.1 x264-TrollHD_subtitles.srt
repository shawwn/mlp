00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:12,792
First lesson of the day. We

3
00:00:08,792 --> 00:00:12,792
very carefully set the table

4
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:15,417
without using magic

5
00:00:12,834 --> 00:00:15,417
so that-- YIPES!

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,625
Did you-- how-- when-- what?

7
00:00:22,667 --> 00:00:23,959
What?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,667
I said no magic. You were

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,667
supposed to do it by hoof

10
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,000
so I could work in

11
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,000
a friendship lesson.

12
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:33,208
Oh. I heard set the table

13
00:00:29,041 --> 00:00:33,208
and just kinda went for it.

14
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,458
Well, if you

15
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,458
hadn't used magic,

16
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,875
you'd have heard

17
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,875
me say, uh,

18
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:41,834
this plate represents your

19
00:00:37,917 --> 00:00:41,834
head, this spoon is your heart

20
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:46,834
and the knives... are sharp.

21
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:46,834
Always be careful with knives.

22
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,208
[sigh]

23
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,792
The metaphors make more

24
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,792
sense when you're actually

25
00:00:49,834 --> 00:00:51,834
setting the table.

26
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,792
Should I change it back?

27
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:56,417
I just want to make sure

28
00:00:53,834 --> 00:00:56,417
you're ready for this dinner.

29
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,417
Princess Celestia will be

30
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,417
joining us tomorrow night

31
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,208
to see how the friendship

32
00:00:58,458 --> 00:01:01,208
lessons are going.

33
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,583
If it's just you, me

34
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:03,583
and Princess Celestia,

35
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,709
why are there

36
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:05,709
four seats?

37
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,542
Well, the whole point is for

38
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:08,542
you to bring a new friend.

39
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,250
That way the Princess

40
00:01:08,583 --> 00:01:10,250
will see for herself

41
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,875
just how far

42
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,875
you've come.

43
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,750
And how good a

44
00:01:11,917 --> 00:01:14,750
teacher you have.

45
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,792
I can't choose. I

46
00:01:14,792 --> 00:01:16,792
like all your friends.

47
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:19,917
That's the best part. You

48
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:19,917
have to make a new friend.

49
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:23,458
New friends?

50
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,834
Hey, maybe I'll just

force friendships

52
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,750

yourself radiant.

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,083
top-notch idea.

154

You really think a new outfit

158
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,792
will help me meet ponies?

159
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:40,583
Oh, with the right outfit,

160
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:40,583
you can do anything, darling.

00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,125
When will it be ready?

162
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,375
Three weeks.

172
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,875
The only thing you want a new

173
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,875
friend draped in is coolness.

I guess my first

186

question would be...

187
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,333
what's a Wonderbolt?

188
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,375
You've never heard

189
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,375
of the Wonderbolts?

190
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:38,166
Where have you been?

191
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,542
Heh... enslaving

192
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:41,542
villages, I guess.

193
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,208
Right.

194
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,208
You're adorable, but probably

195
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,208
not what Twilight had in mind.

196
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,083
What is going on?

197
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:01,083
This is Ponyville!

198
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,667
If I can't make

199
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,667
a friend here,

200
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,083
there's got to be

201
00:06:02,709 --> 00:06:05,083
something wrong with me.

202
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,500
[frustrated sigh]

203
00:06:06,542 --> 00:06:08,333
OK. Calm down.

204
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,875
Nobody makes friends

205
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:10,875
with a total stress case.

206
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,667
Stop stressing!

207
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:17,667
STOP STRESSING!

208
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:39,083
Ahhh. This is just

209
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:39,083
what I needed.

210
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,333
Tell me about it.

211
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,542
You ever have one

212
00:06:41,375 --> 00:06:43,542
of those days?

213
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,750
For me, they're all

214
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,750
one of those days.

215
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,500
Ha-ha-ha.

216
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:51,166
I'm going to start coming here

217
00:06:47,542 --> 00:06:51,166
every time I visit Ponyville.

218
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,250
I'm not from here either. I've

219
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,250
been trying to make friends,

220
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,125
but it's not easy.

221
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,125
They're not saying it,

222
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,083
but I think everypony

223
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,083
knows about my past.

224
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,709
I... may have been

225
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:03,709
a tiny bit...

226
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,750
completely and

227
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,750
utterly evil?

228
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,208
Ponies judge me on

229
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:09,208
my past, too.

230
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,208
Finally, a pony I

231
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,208
can relate to.

232
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:17,500
Soup spoon, salad fork, pasta

233
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:17,500
spoon, strawberry pick.

234
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,375
I'm beginning to think

235
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:19,375
that after Friendship,

236
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,125
the greatest magic

237
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,125
of all...

238
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,333
is proper silverware

239
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:24,333
placement. [giggle]

240
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,083
Twilight, guess what!

241
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:27,083
I made a new friend!

242
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,333
That's fantastic news.

243
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,291
She's great!

244
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,125
Great!

245
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,333
She's powerful!

246
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:33,333
Powerful?

247
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,166
She's--

248
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,959
<i>Hello, Princess.</i>

249
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,709
<i>♪ [horror sting] ♪</i>

250
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:39,750
Trixie?

251
00:07:44,417 --> 00:07:45,792
You know each other?

252
00:07:45,834 --> 00:07:47,542
You could say that.

253
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,959
We've had our

254
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,959
differences.

255
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,792
What matters is Twilight

256
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,792
gave me a second chance

257
00:07:52,834 --> 00:07:54,917
and I appreciate it.

258
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,458
So, um, what brings

259
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:02,458
you to Ponyville?

260
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,208
The great and powerful

261
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:07,208
Trixie has come to perform

262
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,500
a new stage show of grand

263
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:12,500
illusion. I'm calling it

264
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:15,625
"The Humble and

265
00:08:12,542 --> 00:08:15,625
Penitent Trixie's

266
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:18,667
Equestrian Apology Tour."

267
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:19,709
That's kind of

268
00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:19,709
a mouthful.

269
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,291
It's a working title.

270
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,375
Starlight? A moment?

271
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,375
Over here?

272
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,083
I know I said make

273
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,083
friends with "anypony,"

274
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,417
but... well, with Trixie's

275
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:33,417
past and your past,

276
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,291
I'm not so sure she's

277
00:08:33,458 --> 00:08:36,291
the best "first friend."

278
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:43,458
But whatever she did,

279
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:43,458
you've forgiven her, right?

280
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,667
Of course.

281
00:08:44,709 --> 00:08:45,834
It's just...

282
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,333
She wasn't the

283
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:48,333
nicest pony.

284
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:52,083
Well, you did say anypony

285
00:08:48,375 --> 00:08:52,083
and I just assumed

286
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,125
that you'd trust me

287
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,125
to make my own friends

288
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,166
the way Princess

289
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,166
Celestia trusted you.

290
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,375
[sigh] You're

291
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,375
right. I trust you.

292
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,250
Just be back in

293
00:09:00,417 --> 00:09:02,250
time for the dinner.

294
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,875
Thanks, Twilight.

295
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,875
You won't regret it.

296
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:08,542
I hope not.

297
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,375
Ugh.

298
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,667
This Magic Show's gonna

299
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,667
be the greatest thing

300
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:18,291
Ponyville's ever seen.

301
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:25,458
[soft murmurs]

302
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,917
Everypony always says they'll

303
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:30,917
give you a second chance,

304
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,500
but deep down,

305
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,500
they never forget.

306
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,375
That's what I'm

307
00:09:34,542 --> 00:09:36,375
worried about.

308
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:37,500
[sigh]

309
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,875
What is it?

310
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:42,750
I heard what Twilight said

311
00:09:38,917 --> 00:09:42,750
about me and she's right;

312
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:44,667
I wasn't very nice.

313
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,166
So, I'd understand if you

314
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:48,166
didn't want to be friends.

315
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,667
Are you kidding?

316
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:50,667
You're the first pony

317
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,542
I've met who has

318
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:53,542
any idea how I feel.

319
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,875
Can you keep a secret?

320
00:09:58,917 --> 00:10:01,750
What are friends for?

321
00:10:01,792 --> 00:10:03,333
The things I've done,

322
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,166
I did them because I

323
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:06,166
was jealous of Twilight.

324
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,208
She's just the

325
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,208
best at everything

326
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,166
and I wanted to beat

327
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,166
her at something.

328
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,834
Your secret's

329
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,834
safe with me.

330
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,375
Thanks.

331
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,166
Wanna help me

332
00:10:14,417 --> 00:10:16,166
unpack my wagon?

333
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,750
I spend a lot of time on

334
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,750
the road with my wagon,

335
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:24,041
so it might be

336
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:24,041
a tad messy.

337
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,917
Maybe I can help. I'm pretty

338
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:27,917
good at organizing stuff.

339

Shhhhh!

344
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:44,458
Uh, I'll catch up. I think

345
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:44,458
there's something in my hoof.

346
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,291
Sure, the wagon's right

347
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,291
around the corner.

348
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,667
So. How's it going

349
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,667
with your new friend?

350
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:54,750
Great. Thanks for asking in

351
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:54,750
a completely not creepy way.

352
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,709
Because, you know, if it isn't

353
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:57,709
working out for any reason,

354
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,625
I could introduce you

355
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,625
to my friend, here.

356
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:02,959
Nice to meet you.

357
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,458
No, no. You can

358
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,458
come out now.

360
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,792
You like music, right?

incredibly important

dinner with Celestia.

365
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,667
You know, if you decide to

366
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,667
make a last minute change.

367
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,417
So... back at your castle

368
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:21,417
when you said, "I trust you,"

369
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,250
you meant, "I

370
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,250
don't trust you."

371
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:29,083
Who can really say who said

372
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:29,083
what? I know I can't. Can you?

373
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,792
Starlight, I'm just trying

374
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,792
to look out for you.

375
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:37,250
[sigh] I appreciate it, but

376
00:11:33,834 --> 00:11:37,250
you're wrong about Trixie.

377
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,625
She's just like me. We

378
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:40,625
have a real connection.

379
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:44,875
That's kind of what I'm afraid

380
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:44,875
of. OH! What about her!

Please, Twilight! I know

00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,083
you're trying to help,

00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:56,875
think Trixie is the one

390
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,625
to help you with that?

391
00:11:58,667 --> 00:12:00,625
Wow, Trixie was right.

392
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,208
You're not really giving

393
00:12:00,667 --> 00:12:03,208
her a second chance.

394
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,250
I wonder what that says

395
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,250
about how you feel about me.

396
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:13,750
Oh! Now he'd be PERFECT!

397
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:15,083
Ugh.

398
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:22,083
I was thinking.

399
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,667
You said Twilight is better

400
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,667
than you at everything,

401
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:27,792
but that's not true.

402
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:27,792
You're better at magic.

403
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,125
Only when I'm wearing a

404
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:30,125
soul-sucking evil amulet,

405
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,583
so I don't think

406
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,583
that counts.

407
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,875
Funny story. Don't

408
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,875
need to get into it.

409
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:36,750
I meant stage magic.

410
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:42,291
Well, of course. Great?

411
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:42,291
Yes. Powerful? Obviously.

412
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,834
But I'm not the best.

413
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,542
As great and powerful

414
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:47,542
as I am,

415
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:51,500
there's one trick I've

416
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:51,500
never been able to do.

417
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:54,500
The Moon-shot

418
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:54,500
Manticore Mouth Dive.

419
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:56,166
<i>♪ [old-style piano] ♪</i>

420
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,083

Completely unharmed.

433
00:13:19,834 --> 00:13:21,625
That sounds very...

434
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,750
Dangerous?

435
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,959
I was going to

436
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:24,959
say, "cool."

437
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,208
I knew I liked you

438
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,208
for a reason.

439
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,875
I don't know how he did it.

440
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:33,750
If I tried it, I'd get

441
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:33,750
chewed up and swallowed

442
00:13:33,792 --> 00:13:35,333
by that Manticore.

443
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,959
Not if you could

444
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:37,959
use real magic.

445
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,959
Obviously. Way

446
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,959
to rub it in.

447
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,667
No, I mean I could help.

448
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:44,667
You could start the trick

449
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,333
and right before

450
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:46,333
you got chewed up,

451
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,458
I could use magic

452
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,458
to save you

453
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,208
and make you appear

454
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,208
in the black box.

455
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:53,792
I guess that would work.

456
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:58,625
But if you made one

457
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:58,625
mistake, I'd be a goner.

458
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:02,125
When it comes to magic,

459
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:02,125
I don't make mistakes.

460
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,792
Maybe I could be your...

461
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:05,792
"magic-show-helper-pony"?

462
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:09,583
We call it "assistant" in

463
00:14:05,834 --> 00:14:09,583
the magician biz and...

464
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,458
nopony's ever offered

465
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:12,458
to help before.

466
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,875
Well, I'd be honored.

467
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:18,166
You may have just made my

468
00:14:14,917 --> 00:14:18,166
great and powerful magic show

469
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,959
even better, which I

470
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:21,959
didn't think was possible.

471
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,583
We're gonna blow

472
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:25,583
them away tonight!

473
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,709
Oh, I can't. Tonight's this

474
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,792
"incredibly important"

475
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,792
dinner with Twilight.

476
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:32,667
Oh.

477
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:35,959
Can I vent for a minute?

478
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,625
What are friends for?

479
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,166
Even after Twilight

480
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,166
says she trusts me,

481
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,083
she clearly doesn't

482
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,083
trust me enough

483
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,875
to choose my own friends.

484
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,542
I guess you were right.

485
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:48,542
No second chances.

486
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,083
I wish I could say

487
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:52,083
I was surprised.

488
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:56,083
Well, lucky for

489
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:56,083
"Princess" Twilight

490
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,834
I have my magic

491
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,834
show tonight.

492
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,291
If you have to go

493
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:01,291
to the dinner,

494
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:03,625
I completely understand.

495
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,500
I just hope I find

496
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:06,500
a way to survive

497
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:11,250
the Moon-Shot Manticore Mouth

498
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:11,250
Dive without my new assistant.

00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:13,959

[dripping]

501
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:26,667
Starlight Glimmer should

502
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:26,667
be here any minute.

503
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:31,875
Any... minute...

504
00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:31,875
now. [nervous laugh]

505
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,709
How about I

506
00:15:31,917 --> 00:15:34,709
introduce everyone?

507
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,333
Our friendship lessons

508
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:38,333
are going so well.

509
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,750
She made three

510
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:40,750
new friends!

511
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,375
She has such great

512
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:44,375
taste in friends.

513
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:47,125
I don't know where she

514
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:47,125
would have learned that.

515
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,917
Starlight Glimmer? I thought

516
00:15:47,166 --> 00:15:50,917
you said nose-hair trimmers!

517
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,083
What's going on? I'm hungry!

518
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,083
And my nose is too hairy!

519
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,750
HAHA! Cranky Doodle,

520
00:15:56,875 --> 00:16:00,750
you're so funny!

521
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,542
If you'll excuse me, I'm

522
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:03,542
going to check the kitchen.

523
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,583
Maybe she got lost amongst

524
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:07,583
the... artichokes.

525
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,959
Starlight? Has anyone

526
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,959
seen Starlight Glimmer?

527
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:14,959
I'm looking for her.

528
00:16:18,417 --> 00:16:19,250
Trixie!

529
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,542
So this is the "The Humble

530
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:23,542
and Penitent Trixie's

531
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,583
Equestrian Apology Tour."

532
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,625
Ain't that a

533
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,625
mouthful of molasses.

534
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,375
It's a working title.

535
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,083
This is going to be the

536
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,083
greatest night of my life.

537
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,417
Excuse me, our lives.

538
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm so glad that we're

539
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,500
not at that boring dinner.

540
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:41,583
Twilight: Ahem.

541
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,834
You just decided to skip our

542
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,834
dinner without telling me?

543
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,959
Are you aware that

544
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,959
at this very moment,

545
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,083
Princess Celestia is

546
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:50,083
waiting for you at a table...

547
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,792
with exquisite

548
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:52,792
silverware placement?

549
00:16:52,834 --> 00:16:53,625
Yes, but--

550
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,083
This is exactly why

551
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,375
I didn't want you to make

552
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:57,375
friends with Trixie.

553
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,792
Ah-HA! You still

554
00:16:57,417 --> 00:17:00,792
don't trust me!

555
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:03,083
But guess what, "princess"?

556
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,625
It doesn't matter if you want

557
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,625
to give me a second chance

558
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:10,083
or not. Starlight had to

559
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:10,083
choose between you and me

560
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:16,250
and she chose me! Your pupil

561
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:16,250
chose me! So HA. I win!

562
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,208
You win? That sounds like you

563
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:21,208
just made friends with me

564
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,583
to beat Twilight.

565
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,625
Exactly!

566
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:30,750
Wait. I mean, no! I got caught

567
00:17:25,417 --> 00:17:30,750
up in the moment. I like you.

568
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:33,208
Beating Twilight

569
00:17:30,792 --> 00:17:33,208
is just a bonus.

570
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,083
Oh, saying that

571
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,083
didn't help, did it.

572
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,959
I should have known.

573
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,959
Nopony else in Ponyville

574
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,625
wanted to be my

575
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:42,625
friend. Why would you?

576
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:47,250
Wait! It's not like

577
00:17:42,667 --> 00:17:47,250
that! I am your friend!

578
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,083
Oh. [whimper]

579
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:53,291
Well, you "won." I

580

Looks like the great

582
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,458
and powerful Trixie

583
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,125
is back to a solo show...

584
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,667
Trixie?

585
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:05,792
...which is exactly

586
00:18:01,709 --> 00:18:05,792
the way she likes it.

587
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,083
Thank you,

588
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:08,083
Princess Twilight,

589
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,250
for getting rid of

590
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,250
that annoying pony

591
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:14,875
who wanted to be my first

592
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:14,875
friend. I am not sad at all.

593
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,417
I definitely don't feel

594
00:18:14,917 --> 00:18:17,417
like my heart is breaking

595
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,166
into a million pieces.

596
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,709
Come one, come all!

597
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:27,709
Come and see

615
00:19:01,542 --> 00:19:06,542

616
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,583
I was supposed to

617
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,583
perform this trick

618
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:11,333

who was also my great

621
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,208
and powerful friend.

622
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,709
Starlight? When I first

623
00:19:19,166 --> 00:19:21,709
came to Ponyville,

624
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,083
Princess Celestia gave me

625
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,083
room to make my own decisions

626
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,458
and my own friends. I need to

627
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:28,458
give you the same freedom.

628
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,750
I shouldn't have tried

629
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,834
to pick and choose

630

Just like me, you have to

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,125
make your own decisions...

635
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:44,375
using me just to one up you?

636
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,083
From what I've seen...

637
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:47,083
she's the real thing.

638
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:54,375
But it's not my place to

639
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:54,375
