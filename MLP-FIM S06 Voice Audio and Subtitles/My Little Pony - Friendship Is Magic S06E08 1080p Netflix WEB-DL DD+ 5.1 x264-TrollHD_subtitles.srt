I just find it all

94
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:32,959
a little silly.

95
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's mostly a day dedicated to

96
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
presents and candy, isn't it?

97
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,208
And why would you deny

98
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,208
yourself presents and candy?

99
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,875
That's crazy talk!

100
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,750
I THINK what Spike

101
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:43,750
means to say is,

102
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:46,875
Hearth's Warming is about

103
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:46,875
more than presents and candy.

104
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,041
It's a time to spend

105
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,041
with friends and family

106
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,083
when we celebrate a

107
00:02:49,083 --> 00:02:51,083
very important day

108
00:02:51,125 --> 00:02:52,667
in Equestria's history.

109
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,250
I think to most ponies,

110
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,250
it's just an excuse

111
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,250
for silly songs and fun,

112
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,667
not a day to remember

113
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,667
some old story.

114
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:03,667
Maybe you just haven't

115
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:03,667
heard the right

116
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,625
Hearth's Warming

117
00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:05,625
Eve story yet.

118
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,041
Earth ponies, pegasi

119
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:08,041
and unicorns sing songs

120
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,250
around a hearth to fight

121
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,250
back an eternal winter

122
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,250
caused by the

123
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,250
mythical Windigos?

124
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,041
[laugh] Every foal and

125
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,041
filly knows that story.

126
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,250
Not THAT one. My

127
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:18,250
favorite holiday story.

128
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:20,041
A Hearth's Warming Tale.

129
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,375
Oooooo! I love that one!

130
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:28,417
This is the story of a powerful

131
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:28,417
unicorn named Snowfall Frost

132
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,625
who hated Hearth's

133
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,625
Warming Eve!

134
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:34,041
It all began many moons

135
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:34,041
ago in Canterlot...

136
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:38,041
Every home in Canterlot was

137
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:38,041
filled with Holiday spirit.

138
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,083
Every home except one.

139
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,375
It was said of Snowfall that

140
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,375
she was almost as studied

141
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:45,625
as Starswirl the Bearded.

142
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:49,208
Almost, since everypony knows

143
00:03:45,667 --> 00:03:49,208
that Starswirl was an expert

144
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,250
at everything from

145
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,250
transfiguration,

146
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,875
Dimensional Calibration,

147
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,875
Teleportation--

148
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,208
Spike: We get it.

149
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,208
Starswirl's awesome.

150
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,542
Right. The point is, Snowfall

151
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:00,542
was also a powerful unicorn.

152
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,458
She wanted to be perfect.

153
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,542
Anything that got in the way

154
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,542
of that was a waste of time.

155
00:04:05,583 --> 00:04:06,417
Ugh!

156
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,667
[clanging bells]

157
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,041
Well, that batch is

158
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,041
ruined. SNOWDASH!

159
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,083
Snowdash was Snowfall's

160
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:16,083
loyal assistant.

161
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:16,834
What do you need?

162
00:04:16,875 --> 00:04:18,250
Get this mess cleaned up.

163
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,959
Those foolish ponies were

164
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,959
ringing those blasted bells

165
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,083
outside the window and

166
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,083
I lost my concentration.

167
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,625
Whoa. Ponies

168
00:04:24,125 --> 00:04:25,625
actually enjoying

169
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:29,166
Hearth's Warming Eve. Where

170
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:29,166
did they get that crazy idea?

171
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,083
Today is nothing

172
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,083
to celebrate.

173
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,208
Hearth's Warming

174
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:33,208
Eve is a menace,

175
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,458
a dangerous day for

176
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,458
all of Equestria.

177
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,083
Dangerous? It's awesome!

178
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,583
It's the day we remember

179
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,583
how unicorns, pegasi,

180
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,875
and earth ponies came

181
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,875
together in friendship

182
00:04:42,917 --> 00:04:44,667
to defeat the Windigos!

183
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,083
That silly legend

184
00:04:44,709 --> 00:04:47,083
is the problem!

185
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,250
Telling everypony that

186
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:50,250
singing songs and being nice

187
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,000
will solve anything? I've

188
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,000
spent years studying magic

189
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:56,208
and that's not how it works.

190
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,667
I think you might be

191
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:58,667
missing the point.

192
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:03,166
Work hard, learn and use your

193

goal for anypony.

196
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,166
But by all means, if you

197
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,166
want to go home early,

198
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,834

199
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,834
have and spend the rest --

200
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:12,792

00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:15,166

262
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:44,208
me to thank for it!

263
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,417
Wait a minute.

264
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,875
Snowfall doesn't like

265

Hearth's Warming Eve

266
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,417
so she decides to cast a spell

267
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:51,417
to get rid of it all together?

268
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:54,458
That seems a little extreme.

269
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,959
Says the pony who tried

270
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,959
to make everypony the same

271
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,583

00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,041
I THINK what Spike is trying

274
00:08:00,625 --> 00:08:04,041
to say is that everypony

275
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,458
has their reasons for doing

276
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,458
things. Even Snowfall.

277
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,875
And if I could

278
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,875
continue the story,

279
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:12,041
we might just find

280
00:08:09,917 --> 00:08:12,041
out what they are.

281
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,959
Proceed.

282
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,875
Snowfall was all set to cast

283
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,875
her spell that would erase

284
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,125
Hearth's Warming

285
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:19,125
Eve for all time

286
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,417
when a voice from the hearth

287
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,417
caught her attention.

288
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,166
You SURE you wanna

289
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,166

You don't think a spell

299
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,083
like that would get by

the gift is that matters,

00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,250
It doesn't mean anything.

427
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:51,250
It's just stuff.

428
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,125

429
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,125
cupcake means I love you!

430
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,041

How ya doin?

432
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,250

00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:59,250
"Your mane looks AMAZING!"

434
00:12:59,291 --> 00:13:01,083
And sometimes a scarf means...

435
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,333
well, a scarf usually

436
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:03,333
means you look cold.

Hearth's Warming Eve is.

528
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:56,959
I don't suppose that pony's

name starts with "Snow"?

530
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,959

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,542
is just an excuse to party

00:17:12,834 --> 00:17:17,083
the holiday as you wished.

570
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,417
And what happens?

571
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:26,083

WINDIGOS!? They

00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,792
aren't real.

596
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,583
It's just a little

597
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:29,583
filly's story!

598
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,542
They are all too

599
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,542
real, Snowfall.

600
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,834
And your actions will

601
00:18:31,583 --> 00:18:34,834
allow them to return.

602
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,375
The future of Equestria

603
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:37,375
shall be bathed in a blanket

604
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,792
of eternal snow.

605
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:43,500
No! I never meant for this to

606
00:18:39,834 --> 00:18:43,500
happen. I didn't understand!

607
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:46,500
I didn't see how important

608
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:46,500
Hearth's Warming Eve was!

609
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,709
Please, spirit! I haven't

610
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,709
cast the spell yet!

611
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,458
Is there still time?

612
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,458
I'm sorry!

613
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,125
There's still time!

614
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,458
Oh my.

615
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,333
Snowfall Frost?

616
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,750
I was hoping I wasn't

617
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,750
too late for the party.

618
00:19:13,792 --> 00:19:16,208
I brought gifts.

619
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,166
[spits] Boss?

620
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,333
I was wrong earlier. About

621
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:21,333
Hearth's Warming Eve.

622
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,250
It's not all about

623
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:24,250
singing and presents.

624
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,625
The singing and presents

625
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:26,625
are all about celebrating

626
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,625
the ponies in our lives.

627
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,667
The ponies we should listen

628
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,667
to more often. Our friends.

629
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,667
Wow.

630
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:42,250
Dragon toenail? Uh...thanks?

631
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,625
I was in a hurry. I'll

632
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:45,625
do better next time.

633
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,875
[laugh] You kidding?

634
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,500
No one's ever given me

635
00:19:46,917 --> 00:19:49,500
dragon toenail before!

636
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,417
It's awesome! Now

637
00:19:49,542 --> 00:19:52,417
come get some eggnog!

638
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,959

639
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:54,959

<i>Hearth's Warmingest.</i>

644
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:01,917
The end.

645
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,208
Well, that's it. Thanks for

646
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:06,208
letting me read you the story.

647
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,875
Guess you can call

648
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,875
it a night.

649
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Spike and I are

650
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
heading downstairs.

651
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,959
And if you wanted to, you'd

652
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,959
