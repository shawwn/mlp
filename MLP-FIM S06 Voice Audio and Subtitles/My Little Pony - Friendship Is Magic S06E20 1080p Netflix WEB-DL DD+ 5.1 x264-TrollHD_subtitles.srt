195
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,374
in a stack of needles,

196
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,418
but everypony seems to be

197
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,418

<i>I know you've come to this</i>

202
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:42,383
<i>fair city to be entertained,</i>

and I assure you

204
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,053
there is nothing more

205
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,053
entertaining than the

206
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:49,016

207
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:49,016

Oh, I suppose that might be true

if it weren't for the existence,

210
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,395

211
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,395

212
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,397
of the show-stopping

213
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,397
exotic animal act

214
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,400
that Poné Fantastique includes!

215
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,112
Those voices

216
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:02,112
sound familiar.

217
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,404
They sure do.

218
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,866
Flim and Flam.

219
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,119
Why, I won't even dignify that

220
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:09,119
assertion with a response,

221
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,705
except to say that if you were

222
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,705
to consider buying your tickets

223
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,582
from me, I might consider

224
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,582
offering them to you

225
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,543
at a substantial discount.

226
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,879
I have always thought

00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,879
you get what you pay for

228
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,130
and in my humble opinion,

229
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,800
these tickets are a

230
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:23,800
value at twice the price!

231
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,595
Don't let this price-gouging

232
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:27,595

233
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:32,433

Ha! How dare I?

236
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,437
Yes, how dare you.

237
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,437
I call them

238
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,437

[mumbled arguing]

240
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,692
Well, they certainly don't

241
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,692
seem to be getting along.

242
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,403
[gasp] You don't suppose we've

243
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,403
been brought here to help them?

244
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:47,032
Absolutely not!

248
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,545
have had your issues with

249
00:06:57,876 --> 00:07:00,545
Flim and Flam in the past,

250
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,714
but they're definitely

251
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,714
having trouble

252
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,259
and solving a friendship

253
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,259
problem is important,

254
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,344
no matter who's

255
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,344
having it.

256
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,013
Well, of course

257
00:07:07,386 --> 00:07:10,013
that's true.

258
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:11,639
For anypony but them!

259
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,520
I'm sorry you had to see

260
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,520
that. I don't know why,

261
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,523
but those two've been fightin'

262
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,523
ever since they got here.

263
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,525
I thought giving them

264
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,525
these jobs might help,

265
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,320
but I guess it just

266
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,320
made matters worse.

267
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,488
Trust me; I know

268
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,488
those ponies

269
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,490
and you're better off

270
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,490
with them apart.

271
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,492
The two of them together

272
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,492
will cheat the hooves

273
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,911
right out from under you.

274
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,623
I suppose you're right.

275
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,623
Flim's such a showpony

276
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,459
and Flam has such a

277
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,459
head for business.

278
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,502
Why, if they ever

279
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,502
did work together,

280
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,464
they'd be runnin' this

Speaking of which, I

283
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,925
better get back to work.

I'm pretty sure we should

287
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,099
help Flim and Flam.

288
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,269
And I'm pretty sure there's

289
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,269
another friendship problem here

290
00:07:57,311 --> 00:08:01,189

all the way from Ponyville

295
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,198

296
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:10,198

I have one of those.

Well, if he's so smart,

304
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:21,918
he should have no trouble

305
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,963

309

Just ask him; he'll

310
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,554
tell you all about it!

311
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,723
I'm sure you could work

out your differences

313
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,559
if you just sat down and

314
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,559
talked to each other.

315
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,729

Too bad, really. If they ever

stopped shouting at each other,

338

00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:57,449
animal act would be better off

386
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:01,244
if they left, but everypony is

387
00:10:57,491 --> 00:11:01,244
so busy arguing that they can't.

388
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,121
Do you think he knows?

389
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:07,208
I don't know. But I'm starting

390
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:07,208
to think we should find out.

391
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,421
Of course, Gladmane wants

392
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:11,421
everypony to get along!

393
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:15,592
He's the nicest, most

394
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:15,592
genuine pony I've ever met.

395
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,385
Did the director

396
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:17,385
put you up to this?

397
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,762
[whispering noises]

398
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,723
I tell you, if Gladmane

399
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,723
is your friend,

400
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:24,934
you are welcome backstage,

401
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:30,357
but if you are speaking

402
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:30,357
of him poorly, you leave!

403
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,110
Gladmane is the

404
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:34,110
kindest, most gentle...

405
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,572
...most compassionate

406
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,572
pony I've ever known.

407
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,074
My problem is with him!

408
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,455
I just can't figure it.

409
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,749
The only pony who benefits from

410
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,749
all this feudin' is Gladmane,

411
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,709
but by all accounts

412
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,709
he's the best friend

413
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,379
any of these

414
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,379
ponies have.

415
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,882
Well, Bernard, that adorable

416
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,882
bunny from the acrobat's hat,

417
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,260
claims that every morning,

418
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:59,260
Gladmane tells the director

419
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,596
that the star wants

420
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:01,596
control of the show.

421
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,515
And every afternoon

422
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,515
tells the star

423
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:08,186
that the director wants to get

424
00:12:03,557 --> 00:12:08,186
rid of her. But neither is true.

425
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,772
And the Flying Prairinos,

426
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,772
the Pink Prairie Dog family,

427
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,816
say Gladmane keeps

428
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,816
changing their act

429
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,777
to make each trainer think

430
00:12:13,858 --> 00:12:16,777
the other is doing it.

431
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,072
So, all his talk

432
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,072
about friendship

433
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,199
is just a load of

434
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:21,199
apple sauce.

435
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,784
He's gettin' them all to fight

436
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,784
with each other on purpose!

437
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,414
But how can we get everypony to

438
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:27,414
believe that's what he's doing?

439
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,791
There must be a way to trick

440
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,791
him into telling the truth.

441
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,793
Gee, if only

442
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,793
there was a pony

443
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,463
who knew how to

444
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,463
trick a trickster.

445
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:39,551
[shouted argument]

446
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,679
Or maybe, a pair

447
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:42,679
of ponies.

448
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,807
[sigh]. Fine. I guess bringing

449
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:46,807
Flim and Flam back together

450
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,436
might be why we're

451
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,436
here. Maybe.

452
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,652
Sorry if I don't take the word

453
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,652
of some pony off the street.

454
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,821
Even if that street

455
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,821
is in Ponyville.

456
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,824
But Gladmane is behind so many

457
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,824
other friendship problems,

458
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,785
how can you be sure he

459
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,785
isn't the cause of yours?

460
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:11,124
Because the only problem I

461
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:11,124
have is standing right there.

462
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,293
Same here, buster.

463
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,836
Do either of you even know

464
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,836
what you're fighting over?

465
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,423
Gladmane let me know

466
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:18,423
that ex-brother of mine

467
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,842
thinks I'm just a mouthpiece

468
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:21,842
without a single good idea.

469
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,804
Gladmane assured me this

470
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:25,804
former, fraternal foal here

471
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,849
thinks I couldn't sell

472
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,849
heat lamps to yaks.

473
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,852
Sounds to me like neither

474
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,852
of you said those things.

475
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,147
Why'd you believe Gladmane

476
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,147
when he said you did?

477
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,856
Why would he lie?

478
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,151
Because he's afraid that

479
00:13:35,898 --> 00:13:38,151
the two of you together

480
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,779
could move in and

481
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,779
take over his resort.

482
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,739
And if I'm telling

483
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,739
you he said it,

484
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,283
you know it's the

485
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,283
absolute truth because...

486
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:47,868
You never lie!

487
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,290
Oh, brother of mine, I think

488
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:52,290
it's time for a little payback.

489
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,874
The "Canterlot Two-step?"

490
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,877
We don't have the chickens. How

491
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,877
about the "Baltimare Flare"?

492
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,879
Uh, my flare isn't

493
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,879
what it used to be.

494
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,548
[Gladmane over loudspeaker]

495
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,548
<i>Listen here, y'all.</i>

496
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,300
<i>If you're a friend of</i>

497
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,300
<i>mine, you're entitled</i>

498
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,884
<i>to a free night's stay.</i>

499
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,263
<i>And everypony here's a</i>

500
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,263
<i>friend of mine! Thank you.</i>

501
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,889
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

502
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,517
Are you thinking

503
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,517
what I am?

504
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,686
The "High

505
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,686
Roller Hustle"!

506
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,522
The what now?

507
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,107
Trust us, when we're done,

508
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,107
there won't be a pony in town

509
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,900
who doesn't know the

510
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:19,900
Applejackiest truth

511
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,736
about Gladmane.

512
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,489
That is, assuming you

513
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:24,489
two are willing to help.

514
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,783
What size gown

515
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,783
do you wear?

516
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:31,912
[excited murmurs]

517
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,748
What's all the fuss, now?

518
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,918
It's the grand-matriarch of the

519
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:37,918
Rich family, Impossibly Rich.

520
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,047
She's one of the wealthiest

521
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,047
ponies in Equestria.

522
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,550
Well, why didn't

523
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:43,550
somepony tell me?

524
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,721
You know how I like to give

525
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,721
VIP guests my personal touch.

526
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,431
Well, she's not

527
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,431
exactly a guest.

528
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,309
Word is she's planning

529
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:53,309
a resort of her own.

530
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,896
I think she's here to

531
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,896
scout the competition.

532
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,939
Oh, really?

533
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,193
And with her bits, she could

534
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,193
take over the whole strip,

535
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,738
hire away anypony

536
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,738
she wants.

537
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,946
[snarl]

538
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,366
Not me, of course.

539
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,366
I love it here.

540
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,369
My good-for-nothing

541
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:11,369
brother on the other hoof.

542
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:16,207
Pfft. Impossibly Rich! What

543
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:16,207
an honor it is to have you

544
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,626
at my humble

545
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,626
five-hoof resort!

546
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,961
I'm sure Flam has

547
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,961
done an excellent job

548
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,381
showing you around,

549
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,381
but nothing could beat

550
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,385
a personalized tour from The

551
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:27,385
Mane himself! Ah-huh-huh?

552
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,679
[whispering]

553
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,849
You'll have to excuse Ms.

554
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:32,849
Rich, she saves the energy

555
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,975
other ponies spend talking

556
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,975
out loud and uses it

557
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,936
to make more money.

558
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,438
[whispers]

559
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,901
She'd love a personal tour,

560
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:42,901
say, in uh, about an hour?

561
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,528
Well, that sounds

562
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,528
right pleasant.

563
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,988
And if you can break

564
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,988
away for a moment, Flam,

565
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,618
I'd love to see you in my

566
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:51,618
office so I can get ready.

567
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,999
Are all of you sure

568
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,999
this is a good idea?

569
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,668
Abso-tively!

570
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,963
Gladmane is one fish

571
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,963
that's hooked but good.

572
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,006
I sure hope you two

573
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:06,006
know what you're doing.

574
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,675
Oh don't you worry.

575
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,428
When it comes to throwing

576
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:10,428
ponies off their game...

577
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,013
no two ponies do

578
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,013
it better than us.

579
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,891
I can't argue with that.

580
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,898
Hey there boss, Impossibly

581
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:21,898
Rich is just about ready

582
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,025
for that tour. So what did

583
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,025
you wanna see me about?

584
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,028
Actually, there's something

585
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,028
I want you to see.

586
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,033
The grand plan: Every hotel on

587
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:33,033
the strip as amazin' as this one

588
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:35,286
and every one of them mine.

589
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,871
[admiring whistle]

590
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:41,334
And all it'll take is a little

591
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:41,334
salesponyship. Like this.

592
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,711
Hey there, friends, ah-huh-huh!

593
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,088
<i>If you think my</i>

594
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,088
<i>resort is fantastic,</i>

595
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,550
<i>wait till you see</i>

596
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,550
<i>Poné Fantastique.</i>

597
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,179
<i>Tickets are on sale now.</i>

598
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,179
<i>Two for the price of one.</i>

599
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,390
Thank you. Thank

600
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,390
you very much.

601
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,559
Now I know Impossibly

602
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,559
Rich has probably

603
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,521
made you a tempting offer

604
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:01,521
to come work for her.

605
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,064
Well, now that

606
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,064
you mention it--

607
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,568
And as your friend, I'd

608
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:07,568
never tell you what to do,

609
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,112
but no pony is gonna stand

610
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:10,112
in the way of my plans,

611
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:12,031
no matter how rich she is.

612
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,242
And I sure wouldn't want you

613
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:15,242
to end up on the losing side.

614
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,704
Think you might

615
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,704
consider staying here?

616
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,705
Yeah.

617
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,581
Well, all right, then.

618
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,503
They're coming!

619
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,467
And last, but not least, Ms.

620
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,467
Rich, the jewel in my crown.

621
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,970
[whispers]

622
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,097
Impossibly wants you to

623
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:37,097
know she's very impressed.

624
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,892
But doesn't think

625
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,892
you can keep a resort

626
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,101
of this calibre

627
00:17:38,933 --> 00:17:41,101
going for long.

628
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,103
Oh, and why is that?

629
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,147
[whispers]

630
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,984
Because you've got the best

631
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,984
talent in the industry.

632
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:52,446
What stops them from just

633
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:52,446
leaving to join any competitor?

634
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,408
[laugh] Well, you see,

635
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,408
I have a trick for that,

636
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,660
I must confess, ah-huh-huh.

637
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,956
And it all has to do with

638
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:01,956
how I handle my employees.

639
00:18:01,998 --> 00:18:03,082
And how is that?

640
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:07,754
Well... LIKE FRIENDS, of course!

641
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,297
And I treat every

642
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,297
one of my employees

643
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,633
<i>with the kindness</i>

644
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,633
<i>they deserve!</i>

645
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,136
Oh. That's it?

646
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:16,136
THAT'S your secret?

647
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,139
There's nothing else?

648
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:21,726
Nope. Just friendship.

649
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,104
But you know all about

650
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:25,104
friendship, don't you...

651
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,731
FLUTTERSHY?

652
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,358
You knew the whole time?

653
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,114
Never try to con a con-pony!

654
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:35,114
Uh-huh-huh! [mocking laughter]

655
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,872
I'd have thought you'd

656
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,872
hit the road by now.

657
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,124
Whether we were able

658
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:45,124
to fool you or not,

659
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,127
you can't just go on keeping

660
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,127
ponies from getting along.

661
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,504
It's just mean!

662
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,800
Now maybe it is, but it's

663
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,800
a meanness that works,

664
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,177
unlike your pathetic

665
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:57,177
little ploy.

666
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,974
I practically invented

667
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,974
the "High Roller Hustle."

668
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,183
But I suppose I

669
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:03,183
should be impressed.

670
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,394
You're the only ponies to

671
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,394
ever figure out the secret

672
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,063
to my success.

673
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,816
It takes a lot of work

674
00:19:07,105 --> 00:19:09,816
keepin' everypony fightin',

675
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,944
but as long as I keep 'em

676
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,944
convinced I'm their only friend,

677
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,739
all of Las Pegasus will be mine.

678
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,993
Oh, you can't trick a confession

679
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,993
out of a pony like me.

680
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,662
I am always one step ahead.

681
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,998
Well, you better

682
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,998
check your hooves.

683
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,625
Because... you've just

684
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,625
stepped in a confession.

685
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,712
Oh no. Oh no. Wait, wait.

686
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,631
Did that sound OK?

687
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,092
Never better!

688
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,552
Flim and Flam told us

689
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,552
you'd see right through

690
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,221
the fake rich pony bit.

691
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,221
And that once you did,

692
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,808
you wouldn't be able to

693
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,808
resist gloating about it.

694
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,102
This was all part of the plan.

695
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:50,523
Oh now, now friends! Listen

696
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:50,523
I can explain everything!

697
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,026
I think you've done

698
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,026
enough of that.

699
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,193
Darling?

700
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,740
Oh! I cannot believe we let him

701
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,740
almost ruin our friendship.

702
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,161
And our act. Good luck

703
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:03,161
finding another one.

704
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:08,875
Wait! No! Y'all COME BACK!

705
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:08,875
C'mon I'm gonna be ruined!

706
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,504
This is Gladmane, y'all!

707
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:13,504
C'mon you can't do this!

708
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,215
Gladmane has left

709
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,215
the building!

710
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,594
[crash]

711
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,930
I guess the map wasn't

712
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,930
on the fritz after all.

713
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,267
If it weren't for your

714
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:27,267
history with Flim and Flam,

715
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,520
you never would have be

716
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,520
so determined to find

717
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,064
somepony else to help

718
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,649
and we never would have found

719
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,649
out what Gladmane was doing.

720
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,235
And if it weren't for you

721
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,235
wanting to show even those

722
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,695
two con ponies kindness,

723
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,907
we never would have been

724
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,907
able to trick the trickster.

725
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,950
It must've felt pretty

726
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,950
nice to finally put

727
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,286
all your connivin' and

728
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:46,286
cheatin' skills to good use.

729
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,122
In fact, we like to think of it

730
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,875
as a once-in-a-lifetime

731
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,875
opportunity.

732
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,211
Emphasis on the "once."

733
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,296
What do you mean?

734
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,842
While this establishment

735
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,842
undergoes a slight change

736
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:03,012
in management, my brother

737
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:03,012
and I want to assure you

738
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,306
that it remains the pinnacle

739
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,306
of Las Pegasus entertainment.

740
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,894
Which is why we invite

741
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,894
each and every one of you

742
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:14,648
to experience the wonder of

743
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:14,648
the Poné Fantastique Theater

744
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,735
at half the normal

745
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,735
cost of admission.

746
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,113
And, while you're appreciating

747
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:20,113
this historic venue,

748
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,198
totally devoid of

749
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,198
performers of any kind,

750
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,992
we invite you to use the wonder

751
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,992
of your own imaginations

752
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,454
to fill the space at

753
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:28,454
no additional charge!

754
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,165
[excited chatter]

755
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:32,959
Flim and Flam!
