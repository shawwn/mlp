sorry, everypony.

580
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,107
I haven't really been thinking

581
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:14,107
about how other ponies feel.

582
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,943
Well, I hope you

583
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,943
learned your lesson.

584
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,029
Totally! You ponies pulled

585
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,029
off an amazing prank.

586
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,364
I'll have to work

587
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,364
extra hard to top it.

588
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:25,325
[crickets]

589
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,368
Gotcha!

590
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,414
[laughter]
