00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,208
Uh, maybe you could help me

195
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:40,208
figure out what to order.

196
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,667
We're so close to

197
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,667
the pouch store!

198
00:05:41,709 --> 00:05:43,208
It's just a block away!

199
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,250
I could practically

200
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,250
smell it from here...

201
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,083
if I knew what a pouch

202
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,083
store smelled like!

203
00:05:48,709 --> 00:05:50,250
OK, remember the plan:

204
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,166
I will stay here and distract

205
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,166
Maud while you go get a pouch.

206
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,709
Gotcha!

207
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,667
Oh, why thank you for the

208
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,667
kind assistance, Pinkie Pie.

209
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,333
And now I know

210
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:01,333
exactly what to order.

211
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,709
You are very welcome, Rarity.

212
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,083
Now pardon me whilst

213
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,083
I go wash my hooves.

214
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,083
[crash]

215
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:09,166
Sorry!

216
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,125
So, Maud.

217
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:17,750
That Boulder of yours is such

218
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:17,750
an interesting... character.

219
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:21,333
You must tell me. How did

220
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:21,333
the two of you first meet?

221
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,250
It was a dark and stormy night.

222
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,750
Little did I know that my life

223
00:06:23,291 --> 00:06:26,750
was about to change forever...

224
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,250
Look at that hand-stitched

225
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,250
ten thousand-thread-count-

226
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:38,125
velvet-lined rock pouch! Maud

227
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:38,125
will love it! I NEED it!

228
00:06:40,792 --> 00:06:42,166
Huh. Must be stuck.

229
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,917
"Took a sudden vacation to

230
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:46,917
Canterlot with my grand-niece.

231
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:49,291
Back in a few moons."

232
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:53,083
Oh, no. Oh no, no,

233
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:53,083
no, no, no, no, no!

234
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,458
Well, maybe, just maybe, he's

235
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:56,458
already back from vacation

236
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,250
and just forgot to

237
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,250
take the sign down.

238
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,083
Hello, Mr. Pouch Store Owner!

239
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,083
I'd love to hear all

240
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,083
about your sudden vacation

241
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,291
to Canterlot with

242
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:05,291
your grand-niece

243
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,500
while buying a pouch

244
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,500
for my sister, please!

245
00:07:07,542 --> 00:07:08,959
[smashing]

246
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,375
Miss? The store's

247
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:11,375
clearly closed.

248
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,667
But it can't be!

249
00:07:11,417 --> 00:07:13,667
It just can't be!

250
00:07:13,709 --> 00:07:15,291
If I can't get that pouch,

251
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,792
then not only am I not getting

252
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,792
my sister the greatest present

253
00:07:17,834 --> 00:07:19,834
in the history of PSSSD,

254
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,083
but now I have no PSSSD

255
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,083
present for my sister at all!

256
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,583
And Boulder's been by

257
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,583
my side ever since.

258
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,792
Wow. What a surprisingly

259
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,792
suspenseful

260
00:07:33,834 --> 00:07:35,166
and compelling story.

261
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,083
I completely get what

262
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:38,083
you see in him now.

263
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:41,166
Pinkie Pie! You're back!

264
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,750
Oh, your hooves must

265
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,750
be sparkling clean.

266
00:07:44,792 --> 00:07:46,583
Huh? Oh, right.

267
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,083

Hot Fudge Sundae, STAT!

271
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:57,083
[crash]

272
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,917
What happened? Did you

273
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,917
get a pouch for Maud?

274
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,792
Tell me everything!

275
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,291
The door to the rock

276
00:08:01,959 --> 00:08:03,291
pouch store was locked

277
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,250
because the owner's on a

278
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,250
sudden vacation to Canterlot

279
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,667
with his grand-niece

280
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,667
for a few moons

281
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,166
and so there's no way I

282
00:08:06,709 --> 00:08:08,166
can get the perfect present

283
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,959
for Maud and now I don't have

284
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,959
any present for her at all

285
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,375
so it'll be the worst Pie

286
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,375
Sister Surprise Swap Day ever!

[blubbering]

288
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,375
Oh not to worry, dear.

289
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,375
I'll just have to help you

290
00:08:21,417 --> 00:08:24,375
find a new present for Maud.

291
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:27,208
We have plenty of time before

292
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:27,208
your gift exchange at sunset

293
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,291
and all of Manehattan

294
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,291
to explore.

295
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,208
We're bound to find

296
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,208
something Maud would like.

297
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,208
Maybe even more

298
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,208
than a rock pouch!

299
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,583
You're right! Thanks, Rarity!

300
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:43,500
<i>♪ [piano notes] ♪</i>

301
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:46,083
Maud, I can't help

302
00:08:43,542 --> 00:08:46,083
but notice you're staring

303
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,875
at that marvelous giraffe.

304
00:08:47,917 --> 00:08:49,333
I was just wondering,

305
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,625
any chance you could

306
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:52,625
see yourself with it?

307
00:08:52,667 --> 00:08:54,333
Only if I had a mirror.

308
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,917
Now Maud, I know you're

309
00:08:56,667 --> 00:08:59,917
a big fan of rocks,

310
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,458
so get your camera ready

311
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,083
because these are the

312
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,083
most spectacular rocks

313
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,667
in all of Manehattan.

314
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:08,333
Surely there must be something

315
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:08,333
here that catches your eye.

316
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,083
Boulder says they're

317
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,083
all too "stuck up."

318
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,458
[whistle]

319
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:22,375
All right. You and me, Maud.

320
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,083
You and me.

321
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,500
What do you think about this?

322
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:32,917
Or this? Or this? Or this?

323
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:32,917
Or this? Or this? Or this?

324
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,333
This? This? This?

325
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:39,417
This-this-this-this-this

326
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:39,417
-this-th is-this-

327
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,166
I like that.

328
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:43,917
What is it? You have to tell me!

329
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,834
Was it this bike? This

330
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:45,834
lamp? This grappling hook?

331
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,333
What do you like?

332
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,917
I like that fissure

333
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,917
in the sidewalk.

334
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,917
It's an elegant example

335
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:51,917
of thermal expansion

336
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,250
and soil settlement.

337
00:09:57,083 --> 00:10:02,083
[mumbling] WHAT!?

338
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,959
But I... all of this...

339
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:05,959
and she likes a crack?!

340
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:09,333
Did she like anything?

341
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,166
That sister of yours is simply

342
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,166
impossible to shop for.

343
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,417
There's nothing

344
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:14,417
she needs or wants.

345
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:20,625
Boulder? Boulder?

346
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:20,625
Where'd you run off to?

347
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:22,834
There you are.

348
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,041
Sure wish I had something

349
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,041
to carry you around in.

350
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,166
A rock pouch was a

351
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:31,166
perfect gift for Maud!

352
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,125
And I know she would

353
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,125
have loved the one I saw

354
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,875
in the window! It had double

355
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:36,875
stitching, a red drawstring--

356
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,875
and ochre-flecked

357
00:10:36,917 --> 00:10:38,875
velvet lining

358
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:41,417
with reinforced triple

359
00:10:38,917 --> 00:10:41,417
crosshatched seams?

360
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,417
Yep. That's the pouch.

361
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,417
Wait. How'd you know?

362
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,417
Because I'm looking

363
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,417
at one just like it.

364
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,041
Maybe if you catch up

365
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:53,041
with him, you could ask-

366
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:56,333
Excuse me, Sir.

367
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,000
I couldn't help but notice

368
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:59,000
your nifty rock pouch.

369
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,417
Is there any chance you'd

370
00:10:59,041 --> 00:11:01,417
be willing to part with it?

371
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:05,583
I really need it. Like,

372
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:05,583
really, really, REALLY!

373
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,917
So lemme get this straight.

374
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,500
You really, really

375
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,500
need this pouch, huh?

376
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:15,208
I believe I said,

377
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:15,208
really, really, REALLY!

378
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,125
Well, you know

379
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:18,125
pouches like this

380
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,208
are really hard to

381
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,208
come by these days.

382
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,625
But I might be able to part

383
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:25,625
with it for the right price.

384
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,834
So you'll sell it to me?

385
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,625
And I'll finally be

386
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,625
able to give my sister

387
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,083
the perfect Pie Sister

388
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:31,083
Surprise Swap Day present?

389
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,458
Ooh, thank you, thank

390
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:33,458
you, thank you!

391
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
[poof!]

392
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:42,500
Hmmmmm. That's one sweet

393
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:42,500
party cannon you got there.

394
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,625
Tell you what. I'd be more

395
00:11:42,542 --> 00:11:44,625
than happy to give you

396
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:48,375
the pouch for the low, low

397
00:11:44,667 --> 00:11:48,375
price of... that cannon.

398
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:53,250
My, my party cannon?

399
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,834
Well, if you really want to

400
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,834
give that sister of yours

401
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,458
the perfect present,

402
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,583
then you'll have to give

403
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,583
up your party cannon.

404
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:05,417
So what do you say? The

405
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:05,417
pouch for the cannon.

406
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,542
Do you see the exposed

407
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:15,542
chalcedony in the fissure?

408
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,667
Probably?

409
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,083
Whatcha guys looking at?

410
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,667
Oh, you're back.

411
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,333
Darling, I want to get

412
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,333
one more picture of you

413
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,875
and that astounding

414
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,875
fissure in the sidewalk.

415
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,583
And the inspiration

416
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:26,583
just struck me

417
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,291
for the perfect shot!

418
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,083
Be a dear and go

419
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:31,083
stand behind it.

420
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,125
OK, now just back

421
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,125
up a little bit.

422
00:12:37,917 --> 00:12:39,250
Little more.

423
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:45,583
And now just a little...

424
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:45,583
twenty yards more.

425
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,083
Perfect! Hold that pose!

426
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,542
I think we found your

427
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,542
new holiday card!

428
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,291
So, how did it go? Tell

429
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,291
me, tell me, tell me!

430
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,583
Well, I got the

431
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:57,583
rock pouch for Maud.

432
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,709
That's really the only

433
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,709
thing that matters.

434
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,250
Oh, I am so glad

435
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,250
to hear that!

436
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,125
She's going to

437
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:05,125
absolutely LOVE it.

438
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,083
Yep.

439
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,500
Yep? That's it?

440
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:11,291
You got your sister the

441
00:13:08,542 --> 00:13:11,291
greatest PSSSD present

442
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,542
in the history of ever

443
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,333
and all you have

444
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,333
to say is "yep"?

445
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,709
Yep.

446
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,333
But you're Pinkie Pie.

447
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,333
You're supposed to be all--

448
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,250
I'm so excited I

449
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,250
got the rock pouch!

450
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,875
And I know I say

451
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,875
"excited" a lot

452
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:25,333
when I'm actually just kind

453
00:13:22,917 --> 00:13:25,333
of excited, but this time

454
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,458
I'm really excited about how

455
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,458
excited I am about being

456
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,917
this excited over

457
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,917
the rock pouch!

458
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,917
And then you fire off

459
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,917
your party cannon.

460
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,500
Say, where is your cannon?

461
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:35,375
[gasp] Did you lose it?

462
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:38,083
Is your party cannon lost

463
00:13:35,417 --> 00:13:38,083
somewhere in the big city?

464
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,625
Well, I wouldn't say it's lost.

465
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:44,625
I mean, I know where it

466
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:44,625
is, it's just... [sigh]

467
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,959
I can clearly see that

468
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,959
something's bothering you

469
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,208
and I want to help.

470
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,208
But I can't help you

471
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,792
unless you tell me

472
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,792
what the problem is.

473
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,125
Oh there's no problem.

474
00:13:51,834 --> 00:13:54,125
It just turns out

475
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,208
that the going rate for a

476
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,208
rock pouch in Manehattan

477
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,542
is one party cannon. Who knew?

478
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,750
YOU GAVE AWAY YOUR CANNON?

479
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,750
B-but that party cannon

480
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:04,750
is your everything!

481
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,333
You absolutely

482
00:14:04,792 --> 00:14:06,333
love that cannon.

483
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,875
How could you possibly

484
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,875
part with something

485
00:14:07,917 --> 00:14:09,583
that means so much to you?

486
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,625
Well, I finally got Maud a gift

487
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,417
that's just as good as the

488
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:14,417
ones she always gets me.

489
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,417
And that's all that

490
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:17,417
really matters.

491
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,417
Well, I guess I

492
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:20,417
understand. Maybe?

493
00:14:20,458 --> 00:14:22,375
Maud's going to be so excited.

494
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,792
I can't wait to see

495
00:14:22,417 --> 00:14:24,792
the look on her face

496
00:14:24,834 --> 00:14:27,125
when she sees the pouch!

497
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,458
I know. The camera

498
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:30,458
loves Boulder.

499
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,166
After the day we've had,

500
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,208
I'm probably looking

501
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,208
forward to the "swap" part

502
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,792
of the Pie Sister

503
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,792
Surprise Swap Day

504
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,792
even more than the

505
00:14:37,834 --> 00:14:39,792
two of you!

506
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,250
And I'm not even

507
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:42,250
a Pie sister!

508
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,333
I can't wait one

509
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,333
more second to see

510
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,417
the wonderful gifts

511
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,417
you've gotten each other.

512
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,583
Well, you're going have to.

513
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:49,583
We don't just swap, silly.

514
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:53,583
We always sing the Pie Sister

515
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:53,583
Surprise Swap Day Song first.

516
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,834
Ready, Maud?

517
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,667
As I'll ever be.

518
00:14:56,709 --> 00:15:00,667

OK. Time to swap presents!

522
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,583
Hmmmmm.

I knew you'd love it!

527
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,625
It was all worth it!

528

Look how happy she is!

529
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,792
And I couldn't have

530
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:33,792
done it without you.

531
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:35,625
Thank you, Rarity.

532
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:38,500
OK, time to open

Uh! You did it again!

535
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,709
You got me the best present

536
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:46,709
in the history of PSSSD!

537
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,667
This is perfect. This is

538
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:49,667
amazing. This is incredible!

539
00:15:49,709 --> 00:15:52,709
I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT! I LOVE IT!

540
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,458
What is it?

541
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,083
It's little pieces of

542
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,083
cupcake-scented paper.

543
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:01,500
You know. Confetti.

544
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:01,500
For your cannon.

545
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:03,834
Maud, you know me so well.

546
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,834
You really are the most

547
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,834
thoughtful gift-giver

548
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,291
in the world.

549
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:10,083
I'm going to love it five-ever.

550
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,166
That's even longer than forever.

551
00:16:17,125 --> 00:16:18,583
You're right.

552
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,917
That is impressive, but it's

553
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,917
no fissure in the sidewalk.

554
00:16:22,917 --> 00:16:24,667
Play nice.

555
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:27,333
Oh, I'm so relieved to see that

556
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:27,333
you like the pouch. Especially

557
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,667
considering what Pinkie

558
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,667
Pie had to give up for it.

559
00:16:29,709 --> 00:16:30,667
[gasp]

560
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:31,750
What?

561
00:16:31,792 --> 00:16:33,458
I mean, forget I said that.

562
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,125
I'm-I'm glad to

563
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,125
see you like pouch.

564
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,667
You can remember that part.

565
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:39,667
Just forget the second part.

566
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,792
You know, the second part

567
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:41,792
where I said Pinkie Pie

568
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,959
had to give something

569
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,959
up for it. [gasp]

570
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,291
I should just stop

571
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:46,291
talking now. Nothing!

572
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,959
Hee-hee! Yay!

573
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,458
I love my sister

574
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:51,458
and my new confetti!

575
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,917
Why isn't she using
