The whole point of the

himself with the Squizard,

314
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,270
Sir McBiggun would not

315
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:03,270

00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:38,805

335
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,681
go out and have some fun?

of the evil Squizard. The

353
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:17,676
bars are locked tight.

354
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:20,847
The bars exist...

355
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:24,518
in our imagination.

356
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,147
Really, you describe things

357
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:29,147
and then we pretend it's real.

358
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:33,692
It is real...in

359
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:33,692

360
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,196
It's your turn first.

361
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,196
What do you want to do?

362
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,824
Curse myself for attending

363
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,824
this infernal evening?

00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,203
Oh ha ha, oh you

365
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:43,203
mean in the game.

366
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,745
Well, you can do

367
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,745
whatever you want.

368
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:49,083
Then I roll this 20-sided die

369
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:49,083
to see if you're successful.

370
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,085
I stick my head through

371
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,085
the bars and demand

372
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:54,631
for the immediate release

of the Lord of Chaos.

374
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:56,090
That's a big risk.

375
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,510
You have to roll a seventeen

376
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,510
or higher to succeed.

377
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,392
Oh. Bad idea. The

00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,151
another chance.

579
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,198
[Ahem] Captain Wuzz?

580
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:18,198
Can you hear me?!

581
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,160
Oh, you realized

582
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,160
how amazing I am

583
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,997
and that I make you cooler

584
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,997
just by being around me?

585
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:31,211
Uh no, no, actually that's

586
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:31,211
not what I meant to say.

587
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:36,134
[mumble mumble]

588
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,217
What...?

589
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,680
I'm... [mumble....mumble].

590
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,098
We can't hear you.

591
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,182
Enope.

592
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,559
I'm trying to say

593
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:45,559
I'm sorry, all right?

594
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,478
I'm sorry for

595
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,478
ruining your game,

596
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,272
and I'm sorry that I thought

597
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,272
I was better than you.

598
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,233
Now let's play before this

599
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,233
evening gets any sappier,

600
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,193
shall we?

601
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:59,115
Eyup. [Whisper]

602
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:02,035
Huh? Yeah, yeah OK!

603
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,829
What if we forgot the board

604
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,829
and the pieces for a minute?

605
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,789
I mean, the whole

606
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,789
"game coming to life"

607
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,374
was completely terrifying,

608
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,835
but also kinda the

609
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,835
best thing ever.

610
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,796
So, uh Big Mac and

611
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:13,796
I were wondering...

612
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,716
what if you toned it

613
00:20:13,838 --> 00:20:16,716
down just a teensy bit?

614
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:25,766
[chattering]

615
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,267
Huh?

616
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:33,649
[war cries]

617
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,276
I've got your

618
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:36,276
back, Captain Wuzz!

619
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:41,281
[clashing metal]

620
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,159
[panting]

621
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:47,663
[evil laughter]

622
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,999
Garbunkle, follow my lead!

623
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,922
Bullseye!

624
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,423
Nice one!

625
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,094
It's Guys' Night / aww yeah

626
00:20:57,464 --> 00:21:01,094
/ havin' fun now / aww yeah.

627
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,600
We should just close the

628
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,600
door and let them finish...

629
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,769
whatever this is.

630
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,815
No way! Did you see Big Mac's

631
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:14,815
sword! I totally want in!

632
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,692
Yeah, I don't know

633
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,692
what it is,

634
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,028
but it looks like

635
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:19,028
super-duper fun!

636
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,118
GUYS' NIGHT!
