<i>deliver a letter from Gilda,</i>

192
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,221
<i>I took it so I could</i>

193
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:46,221
<i>find the perfect ponies</i>

194
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,932
<i>to help me understand</i>

195
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,932
<i>what those marks are.</i>

196
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,392
<i>Everypony here</i>

197
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:51,392
<i>told me one thing:</i>

198
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,021
<i>I just HAD to see the</i>

199
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,021
<i>cutie mark crusaders.</i>

200
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,397
<i>They've helped everypony</i>

201
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,397
<i>here get their cutie marks.</i>

202
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,485
<i>And I knew, I just knew, that</i>

203
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,485
<i>someday I'd have one, too:</i>

204
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:04,031
<i>a cutie mark of my very own!</i>

205
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,824
That's why I flew

206
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,824
all the way here.

207
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,076
I want to find my own

208
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:08,076
place in the world

209
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,163
and I know you can help me

210
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,163
by giving me a cutie mark!

211
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,415
So let's make with

212
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,415
the cutie!

213
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,501
Whenever you're ready!

214
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,419
Did it happen yet?

215
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,421
Uh, not exactly.

216
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,508
How 'bout now? How 'bout now?

217
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:23,508
How 'bout now? How 'bout now?

218
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,928
Um, Gabby, I hate

219
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,928
to break it to you,

220
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,430
but it sounds like you

221
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,430
mighta heard some tall tales

222
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,683
about what Crusaders can do.

223
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,895
I mean, we are kinda

224
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,895
awesome and all,

225
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,772
but nopony can just

226
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,772
give you a cutie mark.

227
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:41,400
It just sort of... happens.

228
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,987
Though I'm pretty sure it

229
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,987
doesn't happen to Griffons.

230
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,698
Or if it does, we've

231
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:46,698
never ever heard of it.

232
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,701
Oh. I hadn't thought of that.

233
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,704
Sounds like a challenge.

234
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,704
And who could be up to it

235
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,414
but the world-famous

236
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,414
Cutie Mark Crusaders?

237
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,458
Cutie marks: it's in

238
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,458
your name and everything,

239
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,460
right? Right? RIGHT?

240
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,671
Now I have to deliver Gilda's

241
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,671
letter to Rainbow Dash.

242
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,464
I bet by the time I get back,

243
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,884
you'll have it one-hundred

244
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,884
percent figured out!

245
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:07,677
Toodles for now.

246
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,306
Wheeeee! Gonna

247
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:11,306
get my Cutie Mark!

248
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,726
What she wants, it's

249
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,726
not possible, right?

250
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,397
I don't know. But I know

251
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,397
someone who just might!

252
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,109
I've read every

253
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,109
book on the subject.

254
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,111
And I've never read a

255
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,111
thing about any creature

256
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,321
other than a pony

257
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,321
getting a cutie mark!

258
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,532
But Twilight, Gabby flew all the

259
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:29,532
way here so we could help her.

260
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,743
There's gotta be

261
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,743
something we can do.

262
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,996
Say... is there some kind

263
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,996
of spell you can whip up

264
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,581
to make her mark appear?

265
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,001
Um, I don't know if any of

266
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:40,001
you remember, but using magic

267
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,922
to get a cutie mark never

268
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:43,922
really works out all that well.

269
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:47,342
Ohhhhhh... riiiiight.

270
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,345
Crusaders, I'm sorry. While

271
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,345
I can't say for certain

272
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,056
that it's utterly impossible,

273
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,056
the chances of Gabby

274
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,268
getting an actual mark

275
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:56,268
are... pretty slim.

276
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,519
Everything I've ever

277
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,519
learned tells me...

278
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,939
it's just not gonna happen.

279
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:03,233
Oh NO! Poor Gabby!

280
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,485
What the apples are we

281
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:05,485
ever gonna tell her?

282
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:12,533
Crusaders, this is terrible!

283
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:17,205
Gabby really believed in us, and

284
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:17,205
now we're going to let her down.

285
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:19,540
But what else can we do?

286
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,461
Hmmm. You know what,

287
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,461
Crusaders? So what.

288
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,629
Maybe we can't help

289
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,629
Gabby get a cutie mark,

290
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,840
but we can still do

291
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,840
what we're best at.

292
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,676
We can help her

293
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:29,676
find her purpose!

294
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,012
And I reckon doin' that

295
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,012
is the same for Griffons

296
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,932
as it is for ponies... or any

297
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:35,932
other creature in Equestria!

298
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,560
All we have to do is be extra

299
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:39,560
special clear with her.

300
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,147
Like, Crystal Empire clear.

301
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,315
Yeah!

302
00:08:45,317 --> 00:08:47,152
INCOMING!

303
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,906
[groans]

304
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,326
Hiya, you wonderful,

305
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,326
wonderful Crusaders.

306
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,577
I just know you figured

307
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,577
out how to help me

308
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,246
because you're

309
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,246
all so incredible!

310
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,500
Well, Gabby, we've

311
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:01,500
talked it over

312
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,585
and we think we may just

313
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,585
be able to help you out

314
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,506
but not exactly in

315
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,506
the way you think.

316
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,633
See, here's the thing about

317
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:10,633
you getting a cutie mark.

318
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,595
I'M GETTING A Cutie

319
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:14,595
mark! Wooo-whooooo!

320
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,516
Wait, you didn't let me finish!

321
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,766
WHEEEEE!

322
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,769
Um, I think maybe that

323
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,769
could have been clearer.

324
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,607
Cutie mark, cutie mark,

325
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,607
gonna get my cutie mark!

326
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,528
YEAH! Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo!

327
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,907
She's still going! Anypony know

328
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:33,907
if Griffons ever get tired?

329
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,368
What do you think my mark

330
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,368
will be? A lightning bolt?

331
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,620
An erupting volcano?! I don't

332
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:39,620
care if it's a jar of marmalade.

333
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,123
I know I'll love

334
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,123
it, whatever it is!

335
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,376
Hold on just a hoofstep, Gabby,

336
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,420
there's something

337
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:46,420
we need to clear up.

338
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,963
We can definitely help

339
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,963
you find your purpose

340
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,050
but that mark's probably

341
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,050
not gonna happen.

342
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,510
WHAT?!

343
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,012
It's true. Twilight's

344
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:56,012
never heard of a creature

345
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,806
other than a pony

346
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:58,806
getting a cutie mark.

347
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,769
Oh, pfft, is that all? You

348
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,769
had me worried for a second.

349
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,939
I mean, there's a first

350
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:05,939
time for everything, right?

351
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,401
And she didn't say it

352
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,401
was impossible, right?

353
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,652
Well, not exactly.

354
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,655
Well, then if anypony can make

355
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,655
it happen, it's you three!

356
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,950
I mean, you haven't failed yet!

357
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,453
You know what, Gabby?

358
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,330
I promise, we're gonna

359
00:10:19,494 --> 00:10:22,330
do everything we can

360
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:23,998
to help you get your mark!

361
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,255
OH! It's gonna happen! I can

362
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:30,255
feel it! Whoo hoo! Whoo hoo!

363
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,215
Aaaaand, she's off again.

364
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,967
Why in tarnation would

365
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,967
you promise something

366
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,470
that just can't be done!

367
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,473
I know what it's like to want

368
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,473
something that's out of reach.

369
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,475
And just because it

370
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:41,475
hasn't happened yet

371
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,143
doesn't mean it can't.

372
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,146
Maybe trying for the

373
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:46,146
impossible isn't so bad.

374
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,190
I guess we'll never know for

375
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:49,190
sure unless we give it a try.

376
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,692
All right. But where

377
00:10:49,232 --> 00:10:51,692
do we even start?

378
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:56,948
Where we always do, with a good

00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,701
The first thing we gotta

381
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,701
do is find your purpose.

382
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:02,621

387
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:13,881

[song ends]

477
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,492
Gabby's special purpose

478
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:45,492
can't be everything, right?

479
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,993
It may as well be.

480
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,621
I don't know how we find

481
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,621
what she's supposed to do

482
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:52,081
when she can do it all.

483
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,084
And if finding her

484
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:55,084
purpose seems impossible,

485
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,504
we can just forget about

486
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,504
the whole Griffon-getting

487
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,675
-a-cutie-mark thing which

488
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,675
is actually impossible.

489
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,093
I never should have

490
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:04,093
gotten her hopes up.

491
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,846
I Did. It. All! So? Lay

492
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,846
it on me, Crusaders.

493
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,516
What's my purpose?

494
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,936
And how do we get a mark

495
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,936
on these here haunches?

496
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:18,232
Gabby, we... we don't.

497
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:21,027
Wait! What are you saying?

498
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,196
We're saying that since

499
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:23,196
you can do everything

500
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,615
so amazingly well...

501
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,703
we just can't figure out what

502
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,703
one thing you're supposed to do.

503
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:32,913
Gabby. We can't help you.

504
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,334

I WON'T believe it.

508
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:41,922
Gabby! Wait!

509
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,926
We're sorry! We're so, so sorry!

510
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,012
This is just awful!

511
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,015
For the first time ever,

512
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,015
the Cutie Mark Crusaders

513
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:53,934

515

thought we could help Gabby.

517
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,488
I thought we could help anypony.

518
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,075
Maybe that's just it. Maybe

519
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,075
we can only help ponies.

520
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,703
Or maybe we just plain failed.

521
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,956
Failed? Then what

522
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:15,956
do you call THIS?

523
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,668
A CUTIE MARK!?

524
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,295
WHAT? You got your

525
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,295
mark after all!

526
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,089
Even though we couldn't

527
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,089
find your purpose?

528
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,133
But - whaaaa? Huh? HOW?

529
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,969
An' what does it

530
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,969
mean? A cauldron?

531
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:33,140
Um, I don't know. Maybe

532
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:33,140
it means my purpose is uh,

533
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,975
helping uh, Zecora with potions.

534
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,895
That's the first thing I tried.

535
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,314
I guess it just took some time

536
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:40,314
to appear but here it is!

537
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,984
This. Is. AWESOME!

538
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,984
We're not failures.

539
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,737
Whatever we did WORKED!

540
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,531
I had a feeling we could

541
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,531
help you and we did!

542
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,117
Ooh, we've gotta go see

543
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,117
Twilight right away!

544
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,077
She'll want to know about this.

545
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,163
Correction: she NEEDS

546
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:56,163
to know about this.

547
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,791
I bet she'll want to

548
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,791
write a whole book

549
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,835
about the very first Griffon to

550
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,835
get a cutie mark of her own!

551
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:05,548
Oh, totally. Um, but you

552
00:16:00,877 --> 00:16:05,548
know Rainbow Dash asked me

553
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,550
to pick up her answer

554
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,550
to Gilda's letter.

555
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,719
I better take care of

556
00:16:07,592 --> 00:16:09,719
that before I forget.

557
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,430
Here's an idea: uh,

558
00:16:09,761 --> 00:16:12,430
you head to the castle,

559
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:18,519
I'll meet you there, cutie

560
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:18,519
mark and all. Um.... toodles!

561
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,187
Wow, can you believe it?

562
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,732
We were able to help her

563
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,732
get her mark after all!

564
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,901
Come on, Crusaders;

565
00:16:22,774 --> 00:16:24,901
let's tell Twilight!

566
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,030
Gabby? You just missed her!

567
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,030
She was in such a hurry

568
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,365
she didn't even come in.

569
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,368
Just dropped this

570
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,368
letter and zoomed away.

571
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,789
Dear Crusaders: I'll

572
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,789
never forget you!

573
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,792
You really are every bit

574
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,792
as awesome as I heard.

575
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,586
I'm heading home to

576
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:43,586
tell all the griffons

577
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:45,171
how you did the impossible

578
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,842
by getting me my

579
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,842
cutie mark. Toodles!

580
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,384
[crash]

581
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:53,471
Wait a second, CUTIE MARK?

582
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,682
You actually got a

583
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:55,682
griffon a cutie mark

584
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,017
for the first time

585
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,017
in recorded history?

586
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:02,062
You know what this calls for?

587
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:02,062
A full-scale research project!

588
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,481
This makes no sense.

589
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,900
Gabby didn't come in

590
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,900
and show you her mark?

591
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,068
You have GOT to get Gabby

592
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,068
back here right away.

593
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,904
I have so many

594
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,904
questions!

595
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,072
I hope I have

596
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:12,072
enough ink and parchment

597
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,240
to document EVERYTHING!

598
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,910
SPIKE! Guess what just happened!

599
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,412
Weird. Gabby didn't

600
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,412
show Twilight her mark,

601
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,790
like she said she

602
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,790
was gonna do?

603
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,918
Something in this here

604
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:23,918
applesauce smells kinda fishy.

605
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,086
We better find her and

606
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,086
find out what's going on!

607
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,421
Come on, Crusaders.

608
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,633
Keep your eyes on

609
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,633
the skies, ponies.

610
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,176
Gabby can't have gone far.

611
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,512
She's not in the air,

612
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,512
she's right THERE!

613
00:17:34,554 --> 00:17:38,057
Gabby! Hold up, we're a-comin'!

614
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,060
Um, sorry, no time to chat.

615
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,060
I just stopped to help

616
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,771
this pony get out of the muck

617
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,771
and then I really gotta fly!

618
00:17:43,813 --> 00:17:46,273
OK, HEAVE-HOHHHH!

619
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,737
Gabby, we're your friends!

620
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,656
Why in Equestria you

621
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,656
running away from us?

622
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,701
Running away? Oh,

623
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:56,701
I'm not running away.

624
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,747
I'm just, um, excited to

625
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,747
show my lovely new cutie mark

626
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,123
to everyone in Griffonstone.

627
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,920
You mean the cutie mark that's

628
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:06,920
runnin' right off your flank?

629
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:09,129
Yup. That's the one.

630
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,507
I guess the one thing I'm

631
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,507
really not that good at...

632
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,676
is faking things.

633
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,220
Wow, Gabby, painting

634
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,220
on a fake cutie mark

635
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:20,433
to make yourself feel better?

636
00:18:16,262 --> 00:18:20,433
You must have been REALLY upset.

637
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,769
Sure, I was disappointed

638
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,146
but I didn't do it to

639
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,146
make myself feel better.

640
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,900
I wanted to make

641
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,900
you feel better!

642
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,150
[gasp]

643
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,361
I couldn't bear you three

644
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,361
thinking you failed

645
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,864
after you tried so

646
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:34,864
hard to help.

647
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,700
That's why I had to leave before

648
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,700
you or Twilight found out

649
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:42,496
the truth. [sigh]. I'm sorry

650
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:42,496
I wasn't honest with you.

651
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,165
I'll just wing my way

652
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,165
back to Griffonstone.

653
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,167
Thanks for trying.

654
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,295
You don't need to

655
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,295
apologize for caring about

656
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,338
how other ponies are feelin'!

657
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,674
I'm just sorry we couldn't

658
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,674
come through for you.

659
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,177
Hmmm... maybe we can.

660
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,014
Gabby, clean up and meet us

661
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,014
at the Crusaders clubhouse!

662
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,771
I know you all tried

663
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,771
your very best,

664
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,149
but I guess griffons and

665
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:10,149
cutie marks just don't mix.

666
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,778
Maybe I don't even

667
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:13,778
have a special purpose.

668
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,530
Hang on a second! We

669
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,530
were wracking our brains

670
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,575
trying to figure out your

671
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,575
destiny until we remembered

672
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,953
how every time you

673
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,953
did something new,

674
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,622
you tried to help

675
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,622
everypony around you.

676
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,582
Even us! How did it feel

677
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,793
when you showed up

678
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,793
with that fake mark

679
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,671
and the three of us thought

680
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:31,671
we'd actually helped you?

681
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,675
Well... I was really glad

682
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:35,675
I helped you feel happier!

683
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,636
So maybe helping is

684
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,636
your thing.

685
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,764
You might even say

686
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,764
it's your purpose.

687
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,810
But helping just feels good. It

688
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,810
couldn't have anything to do

689
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,229
with what I'm supposed to

690
00:19:45,852 --> 00:19:49,229
do with my life, right?

691
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,232
Gabby, finding your special

692
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,232
purpose doesn't have to be

693
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,027
about being good at something,

694
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,905
it's about feeling good

695
00:19:54,068 --> 00:19:57,905
about something inside.

696
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,241
And it looks like your destiny

697
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,241
is a whole lot like ours:

698
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,827
helping others.

699
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,621
And you don't need a symbol

700
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:05,621
on your flank to know that!

701
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,624
But since we ARE the

702
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:08,624
Cutie Mark Crusaders,

703
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,628
we made you one

704
00:20:08,666 --> 00:20:12,628
anyway! Behold!

705
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:15,255
Your very own cutie mark!

706
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,050
TA DA!

707
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,426
We carved it to mark the

708
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,426
moment we all figured out

709
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,220
what you should

710
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,220
do with your life!

711
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:26,266
But they look just like

712
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:26,266
yours? You can't mean...

713
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:31,814
You bet we do! You're one of us

714
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:31,814
now! Gabby, today we dub thee...

715
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,860
the very first Griffon member

716
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:35,860
of the Cutie Mark Crusaders!

717
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,278
WOOHOO!

718
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,240
You may not be able

719
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,240
to get a cutie mark...

720
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,700
...but you're selflessly

721
00:20:41,281 --> 00:20:42,700
dedicatin' your life

722
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,535
to helpin' others anyhow!

723
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:48,956
I can't think of anything

724
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:48,956
more Crusadery than that!

725
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:53,878
AWESOME! My very own cutecinera!

726
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,090
Landsakes, you sure

727
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,090
have earned it!

728
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,843
And so have we. Scootaloo,

729
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,843
you're pretty amazing.

730
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,178
Even though things

731
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,178
looked bleak,

732
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,680
you still found a way to

733
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,680
help Gabby in the end.

734
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,307
'Course! Helping's

735
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,307
what we do, right?

736
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:11,771
Ooooo, I am SOOOOO grateful!

737
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,190
I'm gonna go home and

738
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:14,190
do my very very best

739
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,526
to bring Cutie Mark Crusader

740
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:17,526
values to Griffonstone,

741
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:19,486
I promise!

742
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,156
Promise us one other thing, too?

743
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:23,950
COME BACK SOON!

744
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:28,328
After all, you're a Crusader

745
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:28,328
now. Crusaders forever?

746
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,290
Crusaders forever!
