Ugh. You even

196
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:41,250
sneeze like a pony.

197
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:46,291
The Gauntlet is dangerous,

198
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:46,291
for I designed it myself.

199
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:51,250
Only dragons with my ferocity,

200
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:51,250

201
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:53,375

202
00:05:53,417 --> 00:05:57,291
We will gather at the cliff

203

207
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,333
and I stopped glowing so

208
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:03,333
let's sneak out of here!

209
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,834
Where do you think you're

210
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:09,834
going, little dragon?

211
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,875
Oh, uh, hi Your Lordship.

212
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,875
I was just going home.

213
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,917
You don't get to leave

214
00:06:16,917 --> 00:06:19,917
unless I say you can.

215
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,917
Dad, look at him!

216
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,917
He's just a runt.

217
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,500
Besides, he doesn't even

218
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:27,500
want to compete. Let him go.

219
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:33,709
He is rather tiny. I could

220
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:33,709
squish him with my pinky claw.

221
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:36,125
[weak laugh]

222
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,375
That wasn't a joke;

223
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:38,375
it was a fact.

224
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:41,750
When I want you to laugh

225
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:41,750
I will say "BE AMUSED"!

226
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,333
Of course, Your Lordship.

227
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,750
I guess I don't understand

228
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:46,750
dragon customs.

229
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:48,875
Another reason why

230
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:48,875
I shouldn't compete.

231
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,750
Very well, little

232
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,750

00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:54,834
Thank you!

234
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,208
And thank you.

No, you're not. You're not

238
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:08,083

239
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,500
I just sent home.

240
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,834
But I'm smarter than most

241
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:11,834
of these boulderheads

242
00:07:11,875 --> 00:07:13,333
and you know it.

243
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,333
Being smart won't help

244
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:16,333
you win this gauntlet.

245
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,208
It was designed for a

246
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:20,208
big strong dragon to win

247
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,583
because it takes a big

248
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,583
strong dragon to lead.

249
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,625
Besides, I SAID NO!

250
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:30,083
I hate when he does that!

When I become Dragon Lord,

00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:37,375
I will make burps an

Why should these

261

That's nothing.

When I'm in charge,

264
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:53,583
the first thing I'll do is get

265
00:07:49,792 --> 00:07:53,583
revenge on those puny ponies!

266
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:56,417
They'll regret they

ever crossed Garble!

we want from Equestria

can we do?

There's only one thing to

have to win the Gauntlet?

You heard them. They have

Ember? You?

578
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:02,083
I know you didn't think

579
00:19:58,792 --> 00:20:02,083
I could do it, but I did.

580
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,875
I expressly told you NOT TO

581
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:05,875
DO IT! Because you're not--

582
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:09,458
I'm not big and strong!

583
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:09,458
I know! But you know what?

584
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,834
I won anyway. So, maybe it

585
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,834
takes more than just being

586
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,375
big and strong to be

587
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:15,375
a good Dragon Lord.

588
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,083
I was wrong, Ember.

589
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:24,875
You might not be big, but

590
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:24,875
you are strong. And smart.

591
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:28,041
And perhaps that counts

592
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:28,041
for more than I thought.

593
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:32,500
And you will make

594
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:32,500
an excellent leader.

595
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,875
Thanks, Dad.

596
00:20:34,917 --> 00:20:36,375
AGREE WITH HIM!

597
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,083
Just kidding. That's

598
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:41,083
not gonna be my thing.

Dragons, hear me!

601
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:52,041
I present to you our new

Dragon Lord... Ember!

I can't tell you!

608
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,083
You did well, Spike. With

609
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:08,083
Ember as Dragon Lord,

610
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,333
the ponies will be safe

611
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,333
and you've gained us

612
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,542
a powerful ally.

613
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:13,083
And a new friend.

614
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,417
Plus, Ember said I could

615
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:15,417
write to her any time

616
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,333
I had questions

617
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,333
about dragon culture!

618
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,834
With this much information,

619
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,083
I'll be able to write a

620
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,083
whole book on dragons!!

621
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,125
And I gained tons of

622
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,125
ideas for a new line

623
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:29,083
of camouflage clothing! I

624
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:29,083
think I'll call it camo-mod.
