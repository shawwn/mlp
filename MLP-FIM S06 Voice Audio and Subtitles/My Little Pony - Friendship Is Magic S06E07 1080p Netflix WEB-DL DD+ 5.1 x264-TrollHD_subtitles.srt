Hey! Rainbow Dash!

3
00:00:10,125 --> 00:00:12,041
Hiya, Scootaloo! What's up?

4
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,166
The Rainbow Dash fan

5
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,166
club just decided

6
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,041
everypony's coming to see you

7
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,041
when the Wonderbolts' new tour

8
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:18,125
comes through Ponyville!

9
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:20,834
Well, it's great that you guys

10
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:20,834
are going to the show, Scoot,

11
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,208
but I won't actually

12
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,208
be performing in it.

13
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,458
Reservists aren't

14
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,458
in the show

15
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,375
unless one of the real

16
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,375
Wonderbolts can't fly.

17
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,667
I'll probably be working

18
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:29,667
crowd control or something.

19
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,208
You're still gonna be

20
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,208
wearing a Wonderbolts uniform

21
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,542
though, right?

22
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,125
A Reservist one, yeah.

23
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,375
Hmm. That's good

24
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,375

we found you.

31
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:01,250
We need you in the show when

32
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:01,250
we get to Ponyville. Flying.

33
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:03,417

what happened, Rainbow Dash?

know every detail!

Start from when you were

a foal and you first knew

76
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,583
your destiny was to

77
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:26,583
become a Wonderbolt!

78
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,750
[chuckle] Well, not

79
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:29,750
much to tell, really.

80
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:32,250
Spitfire told me the

81
00:02:29,792 --> 00:02:32,250
Wonderbolts need me

82
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:34,125
to go on tour with them.

83
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,959
That's really great.

84
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,875
I know how long you've been

85
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,875
waiting for a spot to open up.

86
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:42,792
Yeah, Fire Streak decided to

87
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:42,792
retire and teach full-time.

88
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:45,208
Cloudsdale Flight School will

89
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:45,208
probably be churning out

90
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,959
Wonderbolts with him there.

91
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,208
But guess who was at the

92
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,208
top of the Reserve list?

93
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,208
Ooh ooh! I know! Pick me!

94
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,125
So what do you

95
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,125
do now, Dashie?

96
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,375
I have to report to

97
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:57,375
Wonderbolts Headquarters

98
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:00,583
this afternoon. It's only

99
00:02:57,417 --> 00:03:00,583
two days till tour starts

100
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,250
and I need to learn

101
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,250
the routine.

102
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:04,166
You're leaving already? [gasp]

103
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,625
But we barely started your

104
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:06,625
congratulation party!

105
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,166
I haven't even thought about

106
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:09,166
your going away party yet.

107
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,000
Pinkie, I'm not

108
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:12,000
leaving Ponyville.

109
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,250
I just have to

110
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,250
train for this show.

111
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,208
I hope everything

112
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:16,208
goes well.

113
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,375
It sounds like an

114
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:18,375
awful lot of pressure,

115
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:21,125
having to learn

116
00:03:18,417 --> 00:03:21,125
everything so quickly.

117
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,333
Yeah, good luck, Dash!

118
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,959
Luck? [chuckle] Save that

119
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,959
for the rest of the team.

120
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,458
Now that my awesomeness has

121
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,458
finally been recognized,

122
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,333
the other Wonderbolts

123
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,333
will have to keep up

124
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:34,542
or eat my cloud-trail.

125
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,208
Everypony knows you're a

126
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,208
great flier, Rainbow Dash,

127
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,333
but so are the rest

128
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:39,333
of the Wonderbolts.

129
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,458
It might be more

130
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:42,458
challenging than you think.

131
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,750
[sigh] You're right.

132
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:47,375
I mean, do I show up

133
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:47,375
wearing sunglasses or not?

134
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,542
Sunglasses are

135
00:03:47,417 --> 00:03:49,542
automatically cool,

136
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,208
but anypony can

137
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:52,208
put them on. [sigh]

138
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,917
Maybe I'd stand out

139
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,917
more if I didn't.

140
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,333
Team briefings are

141
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,333
every morning at--

142
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,625
--oh seven twenty.

143
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,709
Because there were twenty

144
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,709
ponies in the original

145
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,417
EUP Guard that became

146
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,417
the Wonderbolts.

147
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,333
Right. And I know you've

148
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:08,333
seen the Academy bunks,

149
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,667
but these are the official

150
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,667
Wonderbolts' barracks--

151
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,375
--built by Admiral

152
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:13,375
Fairweather himself!

153
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,041
[thud]

154
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,667
Don't forget rule

155
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,667
number one, newbie:

156
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,375
always check both ways

157
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:21,375
before crossing the runway.

158
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:32,125
Uh sure, but nopony

159
00:04:28,542 --> 00:04:32,125
else is here!

160
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,166
They will be. And most

161
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,166
of the Wonderbolts

162
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,041
like to make a flashy

163
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,041
entrance, so stay alert.

164
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:38,875
Right. No problem.

165
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,875
Whoa! Is that

166
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:44,875
General Flash's cap?

167
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,375
And the original crest with

168
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:47,375
the Wonderbolts motto on it.

169
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:51,208
"Altius volantis."

170
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:51,208
"Soaring higher!"

171
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:57,000
WOW! [gasp] I mean... cool.

172
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,625
OK, newbie, we've got

173
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,625
a show in two days,

174
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,333
which means you've gotta

175
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:01,333
hustle your haunches

176
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:02,792
to learn this routine.

177
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:05,125
You've got five minutes to

178
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:05,125
get dressed and get outside

179
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,041
to meet the rest of the team.

180
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes, ma'am! I'll have

181
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,000
all the moves down

182
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:10,083
by the end of the day.

183
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,208
Let's hope so. We're

184
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:12,208
all expecting you

185
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,750
to make quite

186
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,750
an impression.

187
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,333
[whoosh]

188
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:24,208
Lookin' good! OK, you're about

189
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:24,208
to take your first flight

190
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:30,041
as an actual Wonderbolt.

191
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:30,041
[sigh] No pressure. [sigh]

192
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,333
Just gotta go out there and

193
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:33,333
knock 'em off their hooves.

194
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,208
OK, Wonderbolts, get

195
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,208
ready to meet your most

196
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,959
awesome member ever!

197
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,667
[excited chatter]

198
00:05:46,709 --> 00:05:47,959
Hey! Look out!

199
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,458
Huh?

200
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:51,166
Whoa!

201
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,291

00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,667

204
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,041
Whoa! Most awesome

205
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,041
entrance by a newbie ever!

206
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:10,000
Are you OK, Rainbow Dash?

207
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:12,125
More like Rainbow Crash!

208
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,875
[laughter]

209
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:21,458
OK, flight school. Get

210
00:06:17,417 --> 00:06:21,458
ready for Rainbow Dash!

211
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,959
Whooooooooa!

214
00:06:31,917 --> 00:06:34,083
More like Rainbow Crash!

[laughter]

216
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:42,709
Rainbow Crash, Rainbow Crash,

217
00:06:35,709 --> 00:06:42,709
Rainbow Crash, Rainbow Crash!

218
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,959
Hey! You guys buzzed

219
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,959
me on purpose!

220
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,542
Not quite. You forgot

221
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,542
rule number one, newbie.

222
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:57,125
"Always check both ways

223
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:57,125
before crossing the runway."

224
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,667
Yeah, well, I was just...

225
00:06:57,166 --> 00:07:00,667
testing you guys.

226
00:07:00,709 --> 00:07:06,000
[laughter] Yeah, right.

227
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,375
All right, nopony got hurt

228
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,375
and we've got a lot to do,

229
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,375
so let's forget about

230
00:07:09,417 --> 00:07:12,375
this and get flying.

231
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:16,959
Classic rookie move, Rainbow

232
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:16,959
Crash. That was amazing.

233
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:23,583
[whoosh]

234
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,875
Higher, Crash! You're

235
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:25,875
breaking formation!

236
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,250
Check your nine, Crash!

237
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,125
Tighter, Crash! Get in there!

238
00:07:42,166 --> 00:07:45,834
[growl] My name's not Crash!

239
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,250
[grunt] Whoah!

240
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,375
Huh! Coulda fooled me!

241
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,875
Hey Crash, I know it

242
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:59,875
was a tough day today,

243
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,333
but don't worry, you'll

244
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:02,333
get the hang of it.

245
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,375
Tough day? Please. If I can

246
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,375
pull off a Sonic Rainboom,

247
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:10,000
I can learn this routine. I'll

248
00:08:06,417 --> 00:08:10,000
have it down cold tomorrow.

249
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,834
Probably even come up with

250
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:12,834
a couple of improvements.

251
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:14,875
Rainbow Dash, over here.

252
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:15,792
Yes, ma'am?

253
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:16,917
I'm glad you're

254
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:16,917
still here.

255
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,166
Oh yeah? Did you want

256
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,166
some ideas on how

257
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,667
to make the show

258
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,667
extra awesome?

259
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,375
Not quite. I know you've

260
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,375
been a Reservist for a while,

261
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,542
but the Bolts have a

262
00:08:24,417 --> 00:08:26,542
few of their own rules

263
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:27,875
you might not know about.

264
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,333
Like worst flier

265
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,333
of the day

266
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,834
has to clean up the

267
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,834
whole compound.

268
00:08:35,875 --> 00:08:37,583
Better get to it, Crash.

00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,166

We know you're probably

277
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,709
tired, Rainbow Dash,

278
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,375
but Pinkie wanted to

279
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,375
throw you a real party.

something, all right.

283
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,083
Well, we can't wait

284
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,083
to hear all about it.

285
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,166
[chuckle] And I'd love to

286
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:18,166
tell you. I really would.

287
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:22,291
But I'm pretty beat.

You know, from all the

290

excitement of my big day.

291
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:31,041
Um, is something

292
00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:31,041
wrong, Rainbow Dash?

293
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,500
What could be wrong? I'm

294
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:33,500
finally a Wonderbolt,

295
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:37,792
which means everything has to

296
00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:37,792
be totally perfectly awesome.

297
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:42,208
Oh no, something is wrong.

298
00:09:37,834 --> 00:09:42,208
What happened, darling?

299
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,667
I told you, it's nothing.

300
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,333
I mean, maybe some of the

301
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:47,333
Wonderbolts started calling me

302
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,583
"Rainbow Crash".

303
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,750
Oh no! Isn't that the

304
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:51,750
same terrible nickname

305
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,750
those bullies in flight

306
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,750
school used to call you?

307
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:57,792
Why would they call you that?

308
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:01,458
Well, I, kinda, sorta

309
00:09:57,834 --> 00:10:01,458
fell into a garbage can.

310
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,834
Ugh!

311
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,750
Well, look at the

312
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,750
bright side!

313
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,250
At least they didn't

314
00:10:04,792 --> 00:10:07,250
call you Rainbow Trash!

315
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,875
So you started off

316
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,875
on the wrong hoof.

317
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,250
I bet every new Wonderbolt

318
00:10:09,917 --> 00:10:12,250
has a tough first day.

319
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,667
Um-hum!

320
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:16,417
What you need is to find a

321
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:16,417
positive way to stand out.

322
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,458
As soon as you're known

323
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,458
for something else,

324
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,959
that nasty old nickname

325
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,959
will be forgotten.

326
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,250
Rarity's right.

327
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,500
Why don't you think of the

328
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,500
Wonderbolts like us?

329
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:29,083
We're a team, but we all stand

330
00:10:24,542 --> 00:10:29,083
out in different ways.

331
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:33,959
That's it! I'm gonna stand out

332
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:33,959
in a different way.

333
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,417
Just like you guys!

00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:40,166
Goodbye, Rainbow Crash,

I just couldn't be more excited

340
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,667
for the big show tomorrow. Are

341
00:10:52,417 --> 00:10:54,667
you guys excited? I'm excited!

342
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:55,792
Actually, I'm always excited!

343
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:58,542
Some ponies even call

344
00:10:55,834 --> 00:10:58,542
me "Dynamic Dash"

345
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,750
because I'm so full of

346
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,750
energy all the time!

347
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,875
Uh, Wonderbolts don't

348
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:04,875
get excited, Crash.

349
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:08,583
You gotta keep a level

350
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:08,583
head to fly the way we do.

352
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:13,333
Well, of course I know that!

353
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:17,250
But the truth of the matter is,

354
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:17,250
you should be excited.

355
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,333
It's the dream of near every

356
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,333
little Pegasus pony

357
00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,792
to grow up and fly

00:11:20,375 --> 00:11:22,792
with the Wonderbolts

359
00:11:22,834 --> 00:11:25,667
and here you all are doing it.

00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:26,917
So are you.

361
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,667
True. Go ahead and call me

"Forthright Filly"

363
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:35,208
if you want, but she-ucks, I

364
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:35,208
like to tell it like it is.

365
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,709
And I believe a pony oughta

366
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,709
appreciate hard work

367
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,792
paying off like this because

368
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,792
being a Wonderbolt

369
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,250
is somethin' special.

370
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,208

00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,000
You know, I was just reading

373
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,000
about how dihedral wing angles

374
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,250
can help increase stability

375
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,250
in banking turns.

376
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,166
It made me think that

377
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,166
pre-flight checklists

378
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,875
could really help

379
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,875
increase our efficiency,

380
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,750
so I went ahead and made

381
00:12:02,917 --> 00:12:04,750
them for everypony.

382
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:09,500

We all know how

388
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,667
wings work, newbie

389
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:18,834
and we already have checklists!

390
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:20,834
Now get off the runway!

391
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,917
[sweet shy voice] I'm so sorry.

392
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,917
I was just trying to help

393
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,333
because I care about all of the

394
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,333
Wonderbolts oh so much.

395
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,458
Yesiree, just call

396
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:33,458
me "Care Mare."

397
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:38,834
Um, but if you're busy now, I

398
00:12:35,667 --> 00:12:38,834
can just come back later.

399
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,667
Or, you know, not at all.

400
00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:48,917
OK.

401
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:54,041
I must tell you how much I

402
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:54,041
just love these uniforms!

403
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,667
Why, ever since I was a foal,

404
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:56,667
I've admired the mixture

405
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,917
of bold lines and

406
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,917
classic contours.

407
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,208
They don't call me "Rainbow

408
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,208
Fash" for nothing!

409
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,500
Uh...

410
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:06,750
The "Fash" is for fashion.

411
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,250
Crash!

412
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,667
I'm not sure why you're

413
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,667
acting like this,

414
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:12,834
but you need to stop.

415
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,458
I was just, you know,

416

trying to show everypony

417

contribute to the Bolts.

routine for now, OK?

423
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,458
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,291
Maybe this will

425
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,291
help motivate you.

426
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,125
"Crash?"

427
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,250
Couldn't you just put

428
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,250
my regular name on it?

429
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,667
That's not how it

430
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,667
works around here.

431
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,041
We all have our nicknames on our

432
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:40,041

433
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,083
Clipper?

434
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,625
Right, boss!

435
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:47,667
Now it's official. Welcome to

something unforgettable

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,250
to add to the routine,

441
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,250
I'm gonna be Rainbow Crash

442
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,250

cotton candy!

to be extra supportive

456
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,375
for Rainbow Dash, too.

457
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,083
Excellent point. It's simply

458
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:31,083
dreadful that she's had

459
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,583
such a rough start after

460
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:34,583
finally achieving her dream.

461
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,875
Rainbow Dash is a pretty

462
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,875
resilient pony.

463
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,166
I'm sure she's shaken

464
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:39,166
off her tough first day

465
00:14:39,208 --> 00:14:41,166
and turned it around by now.

Speaking of - hey Dash!

00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,041
Oh, perfect! Hey, can

468
00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,041
I borrow Scootaloo?

469
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,667
Me? What for?

470
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,959
Oh, [chuckle] I just

471
00:14:49,709 --> 00:14:51,959
needed some help

472
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,583
and figured the president of

473
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,583
the Rainbow Dash fan club

474
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,083
was the right pony for the job.

475
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,083
I thought the Wonderbolt

476
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,083
Reserves were here to help.

477
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:04,166
Oh, yeah, they're all busy doing

official Reserves stuff.

479
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,417
But don't worry, with

480
00:15:04,208 --> 00:15:06,417
Scootaloo's help,

481
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,792
everything's gonna be awesome.

488
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,041
I just need a small

favor from you

490
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,750
that's really gonna make this

00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:25,750
show something special.

492
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,792
Now, the Wonderbolts are going

493
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,792
to fly over this ridge

494
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,125
right before the

495
00:15:28,834 --> 00:15:31,125
finale of the show.

496
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,542
I'll fly by last and

497
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,542
when I signal you,

498
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,583
you zip up the ramp

499
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,583
on your scooter

500
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,875
and kick the storm

501
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,875

502
00:15:39,917 --> 00:15:41,542
What?

503
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,583
That kick will shoot

504
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,583
off a lightning bolt

507
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,875
And then I'll do some

"Rainbow Crash" after this.

00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,000
I've drummed flyers out

580
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,000
of the Bolts for less.

581
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,583
I know and I'm ready for

582
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:06,583
whatever punishment you want.

583
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,583
You guys were right to

584
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:09,583
call me Rainbow Crash.

585
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,458
I've always been

586
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:11,458
a standout flier,

587
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,875
but since I joined

588
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,875
the Wonderbolts,

589
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:16,792
I've only stood out

590
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:16,792
for making mistakes.

591
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:20,041
[sigh] It's been my

592
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:20,041
dream my whole life,

593
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,917
but I guess maybe I'm not

594
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:23,917
Wonderbolt material after all.

595
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:26,625
Are you serious?

596
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,834
You're the most talented

597
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:29,834
flier we've ever had.

598
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,834
And you've saved all of

599
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,834
Equestria like, a dozen times!

600
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,083
I-I--

601
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,250
Of course you're supposed

602
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,250
to be a Wonderbolt!

603
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,583
We've been waiting

604
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,583
for a spot to open up

605
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,834
ever since you

606
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,834
joined the Reserves.

607
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:44,208
But... you guys... all

608
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:44,208
called me Rainbow Crash.

609
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,208
Yeah, so? My

610
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,208
nickname's Clipper.

611
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,291
You know why they

612
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,291
call me that?

613
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,208
Uh, cause you're as

614
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,208
fast as a ship?

615
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,041
Because I clipped my

616
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:54,041
wing on a flagpole

617
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,959
as I was landing on

618
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:56,959
my first day. Huh.

619
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,959
Huh.

620
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Flatfoot. My first day I

621
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
misjudged my landing

622
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,875
and came down right on

623
00:20:02,041 --> 00:20:04,875
Spitfire's hoof.

624
00:20:04,917 --> 00:20:06,041
Daisy.

625
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,208
Slowpoke.

626
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,875
Hoof 'n' Mouth.

627
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,208
You don't want to know

628
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:11,208
what they call me.

629
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,083
[whispers]

630
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:17,125
[chuckle] Whoa, that is

631
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:17,125
so much worse than Crash.

632
00:20:17,166 --> 00:20:18,291
Right?

633
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,542
So, does this mean I'm

634
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,542
still on the team?

635
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,792
You think you can be

636
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,792
part of this team

637
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:25,041
and not constantly

638
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:25,041
try to showboat?

639
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,458
I promise. I spent my

640
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,458
whole life trying to be

641
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,208
a standout flier, but now

642
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,208
that I'm a Wonderbolt,

643
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,792
it's time to be OK

644
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,792
with fitting in.

645
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:35,834
Good. Because I really didn't

646
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:35,834
want to miss the chance

647
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,000
to tease you for years about

648
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:39,000
this catastrophe!

649
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:41,250
I mean, that crash was epic!

650
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:43,750
[everyone agrees]

651
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,542
But you're on

652
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,542
probation for a month!

653
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:47,166
Got a problem with that?

654
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,291
No, ma'am.

655
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,208
Hey Rainbow Dash, we just

656
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,208
wanted to check on you.

657
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,333
Are you doing OK?

658
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,166
I'm doing great, thanks!

659
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,792
Sure you don't need any help?

660
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,166
Nah. This mess is my

661
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:11,166
responsibility

662
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,792
and I've gotta clean it up

663
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,792
myself. And after this,

664
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,875
Spitfire's got me cleaning

665
00:21:13,834 --> 00:21:15,875
the Wonderbolts compound

666
00:21:15,917 --> 00:21:18,750
for the next month. So

667
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:21,625
why are you in

668
00:21:18,792 --> 00:21:21,625
such a good mood?

669
00:21:21,667 --> 00:21:24,792
Duh! Because I'm a Wonderbolt!
