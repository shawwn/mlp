Physics?

00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:24,191
Mm-hm. Specifically, the use of

11
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:28,069

Um. Mrs. Cheerilee, that

00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:35,661

17
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,413
Yeah. Why would we even

Oh, it's very important.

00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:51,226
things aren't like they were

194
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,393
in the old days.

195
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,438
The fastest cart now has gotta

196
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,438
be slick and modern and...

197
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,397
Exactly!

198
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,401
...not Apple at all. The

199
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:00,401
Apples win Most Traditional.

200
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,403
We have since the Derby started!

201
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,282
Why would anypony want

202
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,282
to win anything else?

203
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,868
Now, why don't you head off

204
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:07,868
and get some chamomile vines,

205
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,619
some hickory sticks,

206
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,619
and some apple barrels

207
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,414
and I'll show you what an Apple

208
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:13,414
Family cart should look like.

209
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,127
I guess I do have a family

210
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:17,127
tradition to uphold.

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:22,381
DERBY? Of course I'll help!

213

Wow, uh, Rarity, I didn't

214
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,844
know you'd be this excited!

216

217
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,682
from long, long ago.

218
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,268
I designed my own cart

219
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:33,268
when I was just a filly.

220
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,021
And I was positive I was

221
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:36,021
going to win the prize for

"Most Creative," hooves down.

223
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:41,400
But I came in second. Second!

224
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,199
You? Second for Most

225
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:47,199

[cheers]

227
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:57,458
But I learned a valuable lesson.

228
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:57,458
I learned to know my audience.

229
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,046
And the race cart audience

230
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,046
wants big! They want bold!

231
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:06,343

out! We've got work to do!

233
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,431
This will take all of

234
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,431
my considerable skills,

235
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,809
but I will fashion the biggest

236
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,809
and boldest derby cart

00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,478

Actually, I was sort of

240
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,565
thinking of something more...

241
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,359
traditional?

242
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,486
Oh, ha ha! Oh please, darling,

243
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:25,486

We're doing big and bold!

245
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:32,035
Soon the prize for Most Creative

246
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:32,035
will finally be in my hooves!

00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,371
You mean MY hooves.

Yes, that's what I

249
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:36,290
said "my hooves."

00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:39,251

that finish line first

262
