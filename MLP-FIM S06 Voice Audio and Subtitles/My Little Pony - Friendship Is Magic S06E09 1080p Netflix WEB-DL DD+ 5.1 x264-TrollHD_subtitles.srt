to make my daughter

195
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,709
happy. You understand?

196
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,250
I'm sorry, I just don't think

197
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:25,250
it's going to be possible.

198
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:27,792
Let me say another way:

199
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:31,291
hire her or I raise rent

200
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:31,291
until you no can afford.

201
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:32,917
Oh, uh, welcome aboard!

202
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:37,500
First idea! Instead of clothes,

203
00:05:37,542 --> 00:05:39,625
we sell glow-in-the-dark teeth.

204
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:44,500
Like this.[clank clank] but

205
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:44,500
they'd glow in the dark!

206
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:48,625
Golly, what a splendid

207
00:05:44,542 --> 00:05:48,625
idea! [chuckle]

208
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,625
GLOW-IN-THE-DARK TEETH!

209
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,625
What was she thinking?

210
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,041
<i>[scream] Fluttershy!</i>

211
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:01,625

00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,583
Awwwww, hello.

214
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,083
But what are they doing here?

215
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,542
Smokey made too much

216
00:06:10,417 --> 00:06:12,542
noise eating garbage,

217
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,834
so Softpad's mother made them

218
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:16,834
move out of the trash can.

219
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,709
Then Smokey Junior found a

220
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:19,709
nice home in the crawl space

221
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,959
behind the building, but

222
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,959
Mr. Stripes demolished it

223
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,959
so they were temporarily

224
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,959
camped out in the back

225
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,625
until they found a

226
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,625
new place to live.

227
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,917

have a little jingle bell

278
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,834
when the door opens? I thought

279
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,834
we should have something

280
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,875
with a little more "pizazz."

281
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,834

00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,458
to quiet down that music.

00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,333

323
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,125
is a pretty big deal.

324
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,333
It's natural that Rarity

325
00:09:51,166 --> 00:09:54,333
would be a little stressed

326
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,291
about how it was going...

327
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:57,291
since it wasn't going well.

328
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,959
Still, I think she

329
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,959
handled it all right.

330
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,917

00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,000

00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,875

347
00:10:22,834 --> 00:10:24,875
just postpone.

348
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:27,875

00:10:40,542 --> 00:10:43,917

yourself always sounds

360
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,834
like a great idea, but

361
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:45,834
before you know it,

362
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,959
you're locked in a room

363
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,959

365
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,834
We can do this and we can

366
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,834
stay true to your vision.

367
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:59,125
You'd do that? Fluttershy,

00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:59,125

381
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:18,166
and then make

382
00:11:15,417 --> 00:11:18,166
them be quiet.

383
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,917

the party even better.

00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,041
