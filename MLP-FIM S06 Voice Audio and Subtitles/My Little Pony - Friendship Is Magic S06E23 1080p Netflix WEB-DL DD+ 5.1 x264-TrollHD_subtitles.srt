00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:08,133
Well, that's the last

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:08,133
of it, Filthy Rich.

4
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:13,263
Just Rich, please. And on behalf

5
00:00:08,175 --> 00:00:13,263
of Rich's Barnyard Bargains,

6
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:17,100
thanks for another season's

7
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:17,100
shipment of Zap Apple Jam.

8
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,853
Our pleasure. See

9
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,853
ya next time!

10
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,067
Uh, Apple Bloom? Did you pack up

11
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,067
the juice into the same crates

12
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,945
as the Zap Apple Jam?

13
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,364
Sure did! Now that

14
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,364
I'm getting older,

15
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,909
I want to prove I can handle

16
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:33,909
more responsibility on the farm.

17
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,870
But the crates aren't marked.

18
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,831
You kept track of what when

19
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,831
into which crate, right?

20
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:44,503
Oh. Um... Yep. I totally

21
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:44,503
kept track of everything.

22
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,673
Good. Because we wouldn't want

23
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,673
Filthy Rich to get a shipment

24
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,634
of juice when he's supposed

25
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:50,634
to get Zap Apple Jam.

26
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,845
You know how Granny

27
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,845
feels about selling juice

28
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,930
anywhere but

29
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:54,930
on the farm.

30
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,224
Are you sure he

31
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,224
got the right crates?

32
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:00,019
Sure, I'm sure!

33
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,730
Now why don't you and Big

34

Mac head on out to the house

and let me finish up here!

36
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,738
If you gave Rich the Zap Apple

37
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,738
Jam, then what's this here?

38
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,115
Um... Extra?

anything. Trust me, I know.

00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,229
What could you

75
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,229
possibly know about it?

00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,565

Oh, sugar cube, your

81
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:41,036
big sister lied so much

82
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:45,206
when she was a filly, the whole

83
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:45,206
family ended up in the hospital.

00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,125
WHAT?

85
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,751
Eeyup.

86
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,838
[sigh] You might as well

87
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,838
tell her the whole story.

88
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,007
It might even do

89
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,007
her some good.

90
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,510
When Applejack and Big Mac

91
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:56,510
were just a wee bit older

92
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,680
than you are now, they

93
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,680
both kept squabblin' over

94
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,057
who would run

95
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,057
the farm better.

96
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,312
All I'm sayin' is that you

97
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,312
may have plenty of brawn,

98
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,857
but I'm the one with the

99
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:09,857
ideas on how to run things

100
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,232
better around here.

101
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,944
Applejack, Applejack,

102
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,944
Applejack.

103
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,904
Ideas are all

104
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:15,904
well and good,

105
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,115
but you can't plow

106
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:18,115
a field with them.

107
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,659
I don't know how many

108
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,659
times I've told you that.

109
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:22,243
Too many!

110
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,372
You two horned toads better stop

111
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,372
jabberin' and get to workin'!

112
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,876
Yeah they'd better! I

113
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:28,876
need you to go to town.

114
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,171
The apple blight's been awful

115
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,171
and if we don't get more spray,

116
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,090
juice season'll be shorter

117
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,090
than a dwarf crab-apple tree.

118
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:36,299
[growl]

119
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,968
Like I was just telling

120
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,968
cousin Braeburn last week;

121
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,513
now there's a pony who knows how

122
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,513
to put his back into a problem.

123
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,682
[growl]

124
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,893
Oh hi there, Filthy Rich!

00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,686
Just Rich, please.

126
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,439
And I'd like you to meet

127
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,439
my fiancée, Spoiled Milk.

128
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,193
Honey, this is

129
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,193
Applejack and Big Mac,

130
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,987
the two hardest-working

131
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,987
ponies at Sweet Apple Acres.

132
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,784
You work on a farm?

133
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:02,784
How... quaint.

134
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,079
Oh ho now,

135
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:05,079
dear, be nice.

136
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,455
Sweet Apple Acres

137
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,455
makes Zap Apple Jam.

138
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,209
It's one of Dad's

139
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,209
best-sellers.

140
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,003
You mean one of

141
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,003
your best-sellers.

142
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,296
My amazing husband-to-be

143
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:15,296
is running the

144
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:20,510
Rich family business now. Did

145
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:20,510
you know that? Well, now you do.

146
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,931
Don't mind Spoiled Milk.

147
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:23,931
She's just proud of me.

148
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,142
But she's right; I'm in

149
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:27,142
charge of the store now

150
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,104
and I'm just bursting

151
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:30,104
with ideas I wanna try.

152
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,605
Like what?

153
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,358
Well, how about this? Juice

154
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:35,358
season's around the corner.

155
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,112
Why not let me

156
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,112
sell it for you?

157
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,697
That is an

158
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:40,697
interesting idea.

159
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,491
Well, maybe it's interesting

160
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:43,491
and maybe it ain't,

161
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,786
but it's definitely

162
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,786
not a new idea.

163
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,955
Granny Smith told us your

164
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,955
grandpa, Stinkin' Rich,

165
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,582
used to ask her every year

166
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,582
if he could sell our juice

167
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,293
in your store, and Granny

168
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53,293
told him every year

169
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,378
about the tradition of

170
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,378
everypony in Ponyville

171
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,422
lining up out at

172
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,422
Sweet Apple Acres.

173
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:59,758
So, start a new tradition!

174
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,177
Someday one of you'll

175
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,177
take over the farm

176
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,805
just like I've taken

177
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,805
over the store.

178
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:09,059
I'm guessing it'll be the

179
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:09,059
one with the best ideas.

180
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,353
Well, now, as I've said

181
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:12,353
many a time before,

182
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,315
ideas are all well and good,

183
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:15,315
but you can't plow a field--

184
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,110
You know what? How about

185
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:18,110
we give you three barrels

186
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,403
of juice early, and

187
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,403
if it sells well,

188
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,156
we'll make a deal

189
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,156
for the rest.

190
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:24,616
Oh, hey now! Perfect!

191
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,995
Come on, honey. I've got

192
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:27,995
to get everything ready.

193
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:32,082
Hoo-wee, I tell ya, if the

194
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:32,082
future means me running

195
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:36,170
Sweet Apple Acres and you

196
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:36,170
being quiet, I can't wait!

197
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,550
I just can't believe you'd

198
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,550
make a deal with Filthy Rich

199
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,469
without even talking to Granny.

200
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,346
Aw, Granny will love the

201
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:47,346
idea and then she'll decide

202
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,391
that I'm the one who should

203
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,391
take over the farm. You'll see.

204
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,686
[Granny] See what?

205
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,481
Applejack here had another

206
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,481
one of her "big ideas,"

207
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,859
and I think we all know my

208
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,859
position on ideas, you

209
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,778
can't plow a

210
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,778
field with them.

211
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,780
Right.

212
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:06,158
Big idea, huh?

213
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,911
Actually, more of

214
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,911
an opportunity.

215
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,206
You see, we ran into

216
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,206
Filthy Rich in town.

217
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,415
Did you know he's running

218
00:06:12,247 --> 00:06:14,415
the family store now?

219
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,626
And what does this

220
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:16,626
here "opportunity"

221
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,254
mean for Sweet

222
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,254
Apple Acres?

223
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:24,092
Well, since juice season is

224
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:24,092
almost here, he or, I mean,

225
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,721
I thought it'd be a good idea to

226
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,721
give him a few barrels of juice

227
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,224
to sell at the store

228
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,224
before the season starts.

229
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,059
Oh, is that all?

230
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,188
Absolutely not!

231
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,189
Hmmm.

232
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,529
But Granny, why can't we sell

233
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:44,529
a few barrels of juice early

234
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,657
to Filthy Rich? How's it any

235
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,657
different than when you gave

236
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,660
Zap Apple Jam to Filthy's

237
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:50,660
grandpappy to sell?

238
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,373
Your juice and your jam

239
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:54,373
ain't the same thing!

240
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,542
Zap Apple Jam jars preserve

241
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,542
the flavor for moons,

242
00:06:57,584 --> 00:06:59,460
but juice starts to spoil

243
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,380
the second it comes

244
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,380
out of the press.

245
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,217
That is why every juice season,

246
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,217
all of Ponyville lines up

247
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,887
at Sweet Apple Acres and first

248
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:08,887
come is first served. Hmm!

249
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,931
I get what you're

250
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:10,931
saying, Granny,

251
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,184
but couldn't you make an

252
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,184
exception just this once?

253
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,686
I sorta promised.

254
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:22,109
Meh-eh. Besides, juice-makin'

255
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:22,109
is iffy business.

256
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,403
And we're probably not gonna

257
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,403
have a lot this year anyway,

258
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,820
what with all the blight.

259
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:30,367
I'm sorry, Applejack, but

260
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:30,367
you'll have to un-promise.

261
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,868
Oh!

262
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,915
I hate to say I told

263
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,915
you so, Applejack, but--

264
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,585
You and I both know you

265
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,585
don't hate to say anything.

266
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,255
Well, I've always thought

267
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:43,255
that the most important thing

268
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,715
a pony can do is say

269
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:45,715
exactly what's on his mind

270
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,551
to anypony who'll listen

271
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,551
so everypony everywhere

272
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,637
always knows everything

273
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,637
you're thinking and...

274
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,848
And you don't ever have to

275
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:53,848
listen to anypony else.

276
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:54,975
What?

277
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:56,977
Exactly.

278
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,565
Well, if it ain't my

279
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,565
new business partner!

280
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,360
Um, about the

281
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,360
juice, Rich...

282
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,571
Take a look at what I did last

283
00:08:05,402 --> 00:08:08,571
night after we made our deal.

284
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,034
Woo! Pretty great, huh?

285
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,746
The thing is, I don't

286
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:16,746
think I can get you any.

287
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:21,084
What? But I did all

288
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:21,084
this work on your say-so.

289
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,003
We shook hooves and

290
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:23,003
everything.

291
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,046
Well, you see, at

292
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,046
Sweet Apple Acres,

293
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,383
we've always been about quality

294
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:28,383
and while your basic jam jar'll-

295
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,427
Plus it's been a tough

296
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,427
harvest this year,

297
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,471
what with all the

298
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,471
blight.

299
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,183
Sounds to me like you're

300
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:36,183
trying to make excuses.

301
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,437
Whenever Granddad dealt with

302
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:40,437
Granny Smith, she kept her word.

303
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,148
If you can't do that,

304
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,148
then maybe our families

305
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,193
should stop doing business

306
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:46,193
together. Altogether!

307
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:52,157
Now, now, the thing is, Rich,

308
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:52,157
it ain't really up to us.

309
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,700
You see, Granny's--

310
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:54,742
--sick!

311
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,246
Wait. Granny's

312
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,246
sick? I had no idea!

313
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:02,042
Yeah, nopony did.

314
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,586
What Big Mac means is we've

315
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,586
been trying to keep it quiet.

316
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,422
We don't want people

317
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,422
to make rash decisions

318
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,923
about doing business

319
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:08,923
with Sweet Apple Acres

320
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,302
just because we're a little

321
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:12,302
short-hooved at the moment.

322
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:17,015
Oh my! Of course, of

323
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:17,015
course. I am so sorry.

324
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,810
Please let me know if

325
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:20,810
there's anything I can do.

326
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,523
Much appreciated. But

327
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:24,523
right now, we only ask

328
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:28,109
for your understanding

329
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:28,109
during this difficult time.

330
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,319
Mm hm.

331
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,072
[Big Mac] You were supposed to

332
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,072
tell Rich the simple truth,

333
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,867
but instead you made things

334
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,867
worse with a giant lie!

335
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,287
Well, what was I supposed

336
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:39,287
to do? You heard Rich.

337
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,789
If I told him the truth, he

338
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:41,789
was gonna stop doing business

339
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,750
with us altogether.

340
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,544
Yeah, but that's

341
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:45,544
only because--

342
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,463
I forgot to ask if we

343
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,463
had any oat crumbles

344
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,673
for this delicious-looking

345
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,673
salad, Granny!

346
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:53,176
I'll go take a look.

347
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,556
--that was only because you made

348
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,556
promises you couldn't keep,

349
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,933
but there's gotta be a

350
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,933
better way out of this mess

351
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,685
than by making up some story

352
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:02,685
about Granny being sick!

353
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:03,853
Well, it worked, didn't it?

354
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,939
[knock at door]

355
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,649
Sorry to drop by unannounced.

356
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,612
We just wanted to come by to

357
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,612
wish Granny a speedy recovery.

358
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:17,576
Look, sis, our good friend Mr.

359
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:17,576
Rich and his fiancée are here.

360
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,288
Oh, and they brought

361
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:21,288
flowers. For Granny.

362
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:26,376
On account of she's sick, like

363
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:26,376
you said. Ain't that sweet?

364
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:29,670
Uh, excuse me one second!

365
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:30,713
[slam]

366
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:31,839
[crash]

367
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,759
What in tarnation?

368
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,512
Oh, I'm sorry, Granny.

369
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:37,512
I didn't see you there.

370
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,222
You came blasting in so fast,

371
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,891
t'weren't possible

372
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:41,891
to see nothin'!

373
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,351
Can you go out to the barn?

374
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,895
I, uh, I think we might

375
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,895
have left a blight sprayer

376
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,439
in the orchard.

377
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:51,526
Are you outta your apple-pickin'

378
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:51,526
mind? It's suppertime, girl!

379
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,028
I know, but if we

380
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:54,028
forgot a sprayer,

381
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,197
I'd wanna get it before

382
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,197
dark. You go start counting

383
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,367
and I'll tell Big Mac

384
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:59,367
we'll be right back, OK?

385
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:00,494
[slam]

386
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,122
So from that moment on, I

387
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:04,122
took to referring to myself

388
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,250
as Big or Large or--

389
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,086
Oh Applejack, your brother

390
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:10,086
was just explaining

391
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,797
why he always wears his yoke.

392
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,510
Even though we asked him how

393
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,510
your grandmare is doing.

394
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,762
Oh, you know how Big

395
00:11:16,551 --> 00:11:19,762
Mac can get to talking,

396
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,182
especially when he's

397
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:22,182
upset. And right now,

398
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,851
he's just as worried about

399
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,851
Granny Smith as I am.

400
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:25,935
[door closes]

401
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:29,981
Oh dear. Is she doing that bad?

402
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:32,025
Well, one thing's for sure,

403
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,985
she shouldn't be seeing

404
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,985
anypony right now.

405
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,449
In fact, I'm getting more

406
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:39,449
upset just thinking about it.

407
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,699
Excuse me!

408
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,370
[crash]

409
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,705
Oh, what in the frilly

410
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,705
fumidila has gotten into you?

411
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,708
Sorry, Granny! I just

412
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,708
decided if I helped you,

413
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,044
it would go faster.

414
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,088
Well, you're too late.

415
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,088
All the sprayers are here.

416
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,470
Oh, good. Uh say, Granny,

417
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,682
when did you first fight

418
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,682
the apple blight again?

419
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,852
It was my second year

420
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,852
here in Ponyville

421
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:12,607
and that was before I had

422
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:12,607
the rick on the one knee.

423
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,444
...and others say that's how the

424
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:16,444
trees got to growing so tall,

425
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,822
but to me, it's just

426
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:19,822
how I got my cutie mark.

427
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,618
But we asked when we could

428
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,618
come back to see Granny!

429
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,538
Big Mac didn't

430
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,538
want to be rude,

431
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,958
but you just can't see Granny

432
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,958
right now because she's...

433
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,126
got apple blight!

434
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,130
[gasp] I thought only

435
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,130
trees got the blight.

436
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,842
Yeah, that's

437
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:39,842
usually the case.

438
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,969
The doctors think it's from

439
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:41,969
working in the orchard

440
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,263
for so many years.

441
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,809
You see. We had to take

442
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:48,809
Granny to Ponyville General.

443
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,312
We just got back right

444
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,312
before you showed up.

445
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:54,315
Oh my, that is terrible!

446
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,736
Eww, it's not

447
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,736
contagious, is it?

448
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,821
Um, I'm sure you'll be

449
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,821
fine, but you should leave,

450
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,699
[cough] just in case.

451
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,828
You're right. We're gonna have

452
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:07,828
to hurry if we want to get there

453
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,457
before visiting hours are over.

454
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:13,460
That's right. Wait. Get where?

455
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,670
Why, the hospital, of course.

456
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,297
I'm sure we'll see you there!

457
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,764
Telling Filthy Rich that

458
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:25,764
Granny's in the hospital

459
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,974
just made everything

460
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,974
a hundred times worse!

461
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,517
What are we supposed to do now?

462
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,103
I got it!

463
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,898
...dropped my second best

464
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,898
teeth right in the pig pen

465
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,320
and that was the worst case of

466
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:40,320
apple blight I've ever seen!

467
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,946
I'd love to hear

468
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,946
more Granny,

469
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,324
but we gotta get to the

470
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,324
hospital right away!

471
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,368
The hospital?

472
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,368
Why, who's sick?

473
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,704
You are, apparently.

474
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,082
What he means is, you're

475
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:53,082
needed at the hospital.

476
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,168
Whatever for?

477
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,964
It's the apple blight! It's

478
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,964
starting to infect ponies now!

479
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,301
The doctors need an expert

480
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,301
opinion, and nopony knows more

481
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,387
about fighting blight

482
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,387
than Granny Smith!

483
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,432
Well, what in tarnation are

484
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:09,432
we waiting for? Let's go!

485
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,486
You know, we're supposed

486
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,486
to go in the back.

487
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,698
Uh, to avoid anypony in the

488
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:24,698
waiting room with the blight.

489
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:30,411
Oops, I almost forgot!

490
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,542
This is perfect.

491
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,960
Now you don't have to worry

492
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,960
about catching the blight.

493
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,004
If you say so, dearie.

494
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:44,592
Now you wait right here while

495
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:44,592
I... check on your presentation.

496
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,927
What in the rotten

497
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,927
rhubarb's going on here?

498
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,432
Fancy meeting you two here!

499
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,852
Well, we told you

500
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,852
we were coming.

501
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,605
Oh, I'm glad we found you

502
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,605
because I can't seem to find

503
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,650
Granny's room, or any

504
00:14:57,647 --> 00:15:00,650
nurses who've even heard

505
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,152
about a pony with

506
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,152
apple blight.

507
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,781
Granny's room. Sure. Just

508
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,781
go down here, take a left,

509
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,492
then a right, go down some

510
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,492
stairs, up a bunch more stairs,

511
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,828
through the cafeteria,

512
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,828
left three more times

513
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,207
and then you're there. Easy as

514
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:16,207
Granny's apple pie! Heh heh.

515
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,459
Aren't you coming with us?

516
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,712
I'll catch up! I

517
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,712
gotta find Big Mac.

518
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,676
OK, Granny, just wait here

519
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:26,676
one second and we can go.

520
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,261
Where are you

521
00:15:26,718 --> 00:15:28,261
two going?

522
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,304
Big Mac can't come.

523
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:30,304
He, uh,

524
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,848
might be contagious.

525
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,182
[both] Contagious?

526
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,521
All right. Climb up here

527
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,521
and I'll cover you up.

528
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,523
Then I'll bring Rich in,

529
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,523
tell him you're Granny,

530
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,567
but you're not allowed

531
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:42,567
to take the sheets off.

532
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,403
You moan a few times, he leaves,

533
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,403
and this whole thing is over.

534
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,197
This is spinnin' way out

535
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,197
of control, Applejack!

536
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,450
Now I know you thought selling

537
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:50,450
juice in Filthy's store

538
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,536
was a good idea, but it

539
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:53,536
ain't worth lying to him

540
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,539
about Granny being sick and

541
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:56,539
needin' to go to the hospital,

542
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,958
or fibbin' to Granny about

543
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,958
them wanting her to come here

544
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,627
to talk about the blight, or--

545
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,464
BIG McIntosh, PLEASE JUST

546
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:04,464
LISTEN TO ME FOR ONCE!

547
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,466
This ain't about my ideas!

548
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,551
If Rich finds out

549
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,551
about all the lies,

550
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,262
he'll cut ties with us and

551
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:11,262
the farm will go under.

552
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,140
Now do you want that to

553
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,140
happen or do you wanna help?

554
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,183
Why can't you be Granny?

555
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,183
You're her size,

556
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,352
and this is all your fault

557
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,352
in the first place!

558
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,688
I would, but if I let

559
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,688
you do the talkin',

560
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,982
you'd just ramble on and on

561
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,982
until we all got caught.

562
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,066
[groan]

563
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:27,320
Just lay down, keep still

564
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:31,073
and promise me you won't say

565
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:31,073
anything for once in your life.

566
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,492
Eeyup.

567
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,788
Granny!

568
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,417
Granny.

569
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,838
It's about time. What

570
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,838
is going on around here?

571
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,090
