00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,750
with your father

4
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:06,750

I'm so glad you asked.

6
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,917
And it was super awesome

7
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,917
of you to invite me too.

8
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:13,417
Things have been so busy

9
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:13,417
with the Wonderbolts lately;

10
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,709
it's great to get a chance

11
00:00:13,458 --> 00:00:16,709
to relax someplace quiet.

12
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,041
That's exactly what I intend

13
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,041
to do now that I've retired.

14
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,500
In fact, I converted

15
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,500
the back house

16
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:24,166
to showcase my

17
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:24,166

18
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,041
I have my clouds; your

19
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:27,041

20
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,500
you've got your animals

21
00:00:27,083 --> 00:00:29,500
and your brother...

22
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:35,125
Zephyr Breeze has

23
00:00:31,375 --> 00:00:35,125
his... interests.

24
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,583
I'll say. Remember when he

25
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:38,583
was convinced square clouds

26
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,875
were gonna be the next

27
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,875
big thing? [snort]

28
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,083
He's matured a

29
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:44,083
lot since then.

30
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,959
Actually, it's funny

31
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,959
you bring Zephyr up.

32
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:53,000
Oh, no! Not again.

Zephyr Breeze.

195
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,583
Oh, that makes more sense.

196
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,208
And from the look

197
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,208
on your face,

198
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,875
I'm guessing it's for another

199
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:05,875
one of his 'extended' stays.

200
00:06:05,917 --> 00:06:09,417
She's a bit peeved.

201
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,250
Zephyr is my brother

202
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,250
and I love him,

203
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,834
but he's never learned to

204
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,834
do anything for himself

205
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,917
and I don't know why my

206
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:15,917
parents keep letting him

207
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,458
trot all over them.

208
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,792
Well, if your parents won't

209
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,792
stand up for themselves,

210
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:23,375

Oh, hey sis! Come to see me work

218
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:44,250
my magic and turn this place

219
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:48,250
from drab to fab, huh?

220

223
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,166
Yeah, I'm getting

224
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,166
rid of this old stuff

225
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,875
so I can turn the back

226
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:55,875
house into my art studio.

227
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:59,166
I've decided I'm going

228
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:59,166

Mom's flowers.

231
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:05,041
She's gonna move them so I can

232
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:05,041
have my meditation patio here.

233
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,250
She loves replanting

234
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:08,250

235
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:13,041
And Dad's been collecting

237
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:15,333

00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,667

242
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,667

244
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,875
But why hold onto

245
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,875
the past, really?

246
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,875
You can't just fly in

247
00:07:26,917 --> 00:07:28,875
and change everything

248
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,917
Mom and Dad have

249
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:30,917
built here.

250
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,542
But this is the only

251
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,542
place big enough

252
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,125

Ooh, unless I do it

256
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,291
I know speaking up for yourself

257
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:42,291
can be hard, believe me.

258
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,834
But Zephyr will never stand on

259
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:45,834
his own if he can lean on you.

260
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,709
Don't be so

261
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,709

262
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,417
Mom and Dad just want

263
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,417
to let me be me, right?

264
00:07:52,458 --> 00:07:55,166
I can do plenty on my own.

265
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,625
I agree. Which is why

266
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,625
you should move out.

267
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh. Well, I mean,

268
00:07:59,667 --> 00:08:03,000
I totally would.

269
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:07,041
But I don't think that's

270
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:07,041
what Mom and Dad want.

271
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:10,000
It's not, is it?

272
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,834
Uh...

273
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:16,417
You know we love you, son.

274
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:16,417
But your sister has a point.

275
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,959
Sure. I mean, I really

276
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:22,959
just came back here to keep

277
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,542
you guys company. But

278
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,542
whatever's best for the family.

279
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:31,208
I just...I just gotta

280
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:31,208
grab a few essentials.

281
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,125
And you definitely have

282
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,125
somewhere else to go?

283
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,000
Of course! There's plenty

284
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,000
of ponies who'd love

285
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:40,834

So, where's Zeph

288
00:08:47,792 --> 00:08:50,208
gonna go now?

289
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,583
I'm not sure. Oh, I hope

290
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,583
I did the right thing.

find someplace else to live,

300
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,166
I don't think

301
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,166
they meant here.

00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,917
But I'm actually

387
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,917
kinda into this look.

388
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,750
So, I guess what I'm saying

389
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:55,750
is... you're welcome.

390
00:11:55,792 --> 00:11:58,375
Wha-- Oh, uggh.

391
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,750
Zephyr, this is

392
00:11:58,417 --> 00:12:01,750
just unacceptable!

393
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:06,417
Wow. I guess I know when my

394
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:06,417
efforts aren't appreciated!

395
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:09,250
[exasperated groan]

396
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,250
[door closes]

397
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,625
[nervous giggle]

398
00:12:11,667 --> 00:12:15,291
Whoa, those are tall.

399
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,500
I'm glad you noticed because

400
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,500
they're your new job.

401
00:12:18,542 --> 00:12:19,917
Wha-?

402
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,625
You said you were taking me

403
00:12:19,959 --> 00:12:22,625
to tea with the princess.

404
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:26,000
Actually, I said I was going

405
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:26,000
to tea with the princess.

406
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:28,542
You're going to work.

407
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,959
Sis, c'mon!

408
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,792
Don't worry, Zephyr.

409
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,792
It'll be easy.

410
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:36,208
I just need a Pegasus pony to

411
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:36,208
fly up and wipe each window down

412
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,542
from top to bottom.

413
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,792
And I'm here to make

414
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,792
sure you do it right!

415
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,542
Wow, Zephyr, this

416
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,542
looks amazing!

417
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,792
Well, you know, like

418
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,792
you said, it was easy.

419
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,792
Where's Spike?

420
00:12:54,834 --> 00:12:56,417
<i>Up here!</i>

421
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,834
You were supposed to supervise,

422
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:59,834
not do all the work.

423
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,834
I was supervising! And

424
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,834
then Zephyr asked me about

425
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,834
different cleaning techniques

426
00:13:02,875 --> 00:13:04,834
and which one was best

427
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,000
and if I could--

428
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,166
Hey! I did all

429
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:09,166
the work.

430
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,792
Don't let him fool you, ol'

431
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:12,792
Spike is quite the taskmaster.

432
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,583
Oh, come on, sis.

433
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,792
I had to ask Spike to make

434
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:22,792
sure I was doing it right.

435
00:13:22,834 --> 00:13:24,583
You didn't do it at all!

436
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,000
Well, I guarantee there

437
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,000
won't be any fooling around

438
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,625
on the next job.

439
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:32,834
Next job?

440
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,709
[whoosh]

441
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,625
That's right, Zeph.

442
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,625
You're coming with me.

443
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,834
You don't have to come

444
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,834
up with some excuse

445
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,792
to hang out with

446
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,792
me, Rainbows.

447
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:47,291
Let's just go for a fly and

448
00:13:42,834 --> 00:13:47,291
see where the day takes us.

449
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,291
Ugh, we're going to

450
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:51,291
Wonderbolts' Headquarters

451
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:55,291
and I am going to give you a job

452
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:55,291
so simple and straightforward,

453
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,083
not even you can weasel

454
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,083
your way out of it.

455
00:13:58,125 --> 00:13:59,417
And the second you try,

456
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,834
I'm going to zap you with

457
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:01,834
a storm cloud. Got it?

458
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:06,250
Oh, I got it. I can already feel

459
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:06,250
the electricity between us.

460
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,083
Zephyr: Rainbow

461
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,083
Dash is crazy, OK?

462
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,000
She expects me to do stuff right

463
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,000
when she asks me to do it!

464
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:20,083
It's insane!

465
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:23,083
So you just quit? Again?

466
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,875
Escaped is more like it.

467
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,333
Besides, what was

468
00:14:24,917 --> 00:14:27,333
I supposed to do?

469
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,291
Keep trying? Finish

470
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:30,291
something for once?

471
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,875
Maybe that way, you'd actually

472
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:33,875
find something you like to do.

473
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:38,041
That all sounds fine for your

474
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:38,041
friends, but it's just not me.

475
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,500
Then I'm sorry, Zephyr, but I

476
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,500
don't think you can live here.

477
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,250
Fine. I'll just go

478
00:14:44,542 --> 00:14:46,250
live in the woods

479
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:48,375
like my foreponies before me.

480
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,959
Guess the only breeze this

481
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:56,959
Zephyr can count on is his own.

482
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:08,291
Aww cheer up, Fluttershy.

483
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,083
I know it was hard, but

484
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,083
you did the right thing.

485
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,583
You couldn't let Zephyr

486
00:15:11,125 --> 00:15:13,583
pull the same stuff on you

487
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,959
that he's always

488
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,959
pulled on your folks.

489
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,291
I guess so.

491
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,792

[chirps]

493
00:15:21,667 --> 00:15:23,375
Oh? Oh, dear.

494
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,250
See, Wigford, The Breeze needs

495
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,250
no pony. We've got food...

496
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,500
Shelter...

497
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:33,333
Just need to put

498
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:33,333
the ol' kettle on.

499
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,417
Come on, stickie-stickie

500
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:43,417
make with the sparks.

[clank clank clank]

502
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:51,291
Ugh! What's a pony gotta do to

503
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:51,291
find a decent stick around here?

504

[grunts]

505
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,166
I know he needs to learn to

506
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:03,166
do things for himself, but...

507
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,375
I can't let him

508
00:16:03,208 --> 00:16:05,375
live like this.

509
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,625
Actually, I don't think he'd

510
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:10,625
make it through the night.

511
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,041
Fluttershy! Hey! I was just, um,

512
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:20,041
cozying up in my sleeping bag.

513
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,000
Ready to call it

514
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,000
an early night.

515
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,625
Such an exhausting

516
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,625
day, you know?

517
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,000
It's noon.

518
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,000
You know me: siesta!

519
00:16:32,834 --> 00:16:33,667
[clunk]

520
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:39,208
UGH! I can't do this.

521
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:39,208
I can't do anything.

522
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,667
Zephyr, you're

523
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,667
smart and talented.

524
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,792
You could do anything

525
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:44,792
if you just tried.

526
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,583
And what if I give everything

527
00:16:44,834 --> 00:16:47,583
I have and still fail?

528
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,458
Honestly, I think it's

529
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:50,458
better not to try at all.

530
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,417
But then you won't

531
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,417
ever do anything.

532
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,875
I don't expect you

533
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,875
two to understand.

534
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:58,417
I mean, when have

535
00:16:55,917 --> 00:16:58,417
you ever failed?

536
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,917
You've literally helped save

537
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,917
Equestria, like, a dozen times.

538
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,875
And I was worried that

539
00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:04,875
I'd fail every time.

540
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:09,250
Sometimes you have to do things

541
00:17:04,917 --> 00:17:09,250
even though you might fail.

542
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:11,000
But failing is the worst!

543
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,250
And quitting doesn't feel

544
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,250
much better, does it?

545
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,250
No.

546
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,917
So here's the deal: You

547
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:16,917
can come back with me,

548
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,458
but you have to do exactly

549
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,458
what I say, no exceptions.

550
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,083
I will literally do

551
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,083
anything you ask me

552
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,625
if it means I don't

553
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:27,625
have to stay here.

554
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,792
OK, you know what you

555
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,792
have to do, right?

556
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:36,125
Beg for help, then quit

557
00:17:33,834 --> 00:17:36,125
when I get frustrated.

613
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:53,083
I did it. I actually finished

00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:53,083
something. By myself.

615
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,375
And it looks exactly

616
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:55,375
like it's supposed to.

617
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,250
I knew you could do

618
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,250
it, Zephyr.

619
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,792
I didn't!

620
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:02,959
But I do now. Thanks, for

621
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:02,959
believing in me, sis.

622
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's what big

623
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
sisters are for.

624
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:10,250
So, Zeph, now that you've

625
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:10,250
accomplished this, what's next?

626
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:14,834
Anything I want! I mean,

627
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:14,834
the sky's the limit, right?

628
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,667
But, you know, I've got

629
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,667
some baby steps in mind.

630
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:26,583
Thanks for dinner, Mr. and Mrs.

631
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:26,583
Shy. It was great, as usual.

632
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,041
Thank you, dear, for

633
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,041
not giving up on Zephyr.

634
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,417
After all these years

635
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,417
of pining for him,

636
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:36,041
it must be so satisfying to

637
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:36,041
see him on the right track.

638
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,000
Have you heard from

639
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,000
Zephyr? Is he doing well?

640
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,291
I tell you, he's

641
00:20:41,041 --> 00:20:43,291
a brand new pony.

642
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,083
So full of drive

643
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:46,083
and determination.

644
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:48,000
That's great.

645
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:52,125
Guess who graduated from

646
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:52,125
mane therapy training?

647
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:56,417
Awesome!

648
00:20:56,458 --> 00:20:58,166
Congratulations, son.

649
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,709
You look so handsome!

650
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,875
I'm so proud of

651
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,875
you, Zephyr.

652
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:06,625
It was only a

653
00:21:04,917 --> 00:21:06,625
matter of time

654
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:10,375
before they recognized

655
00:21:06,667 --> 00:21:10,375
my true genius.

656
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,875
But actually doing the

657
00:21:10,417 --> 00:21:13,875
work probably helped.

658
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,709
And I wouldn't have

659
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:16,709
if it weren't for you.

660
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,375
Oh I just gave you

661
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,375
some encouragement;

662
00:21:19,417 --> 00:21:21,333
you did this on your own.

663
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,000
And honestly, right now I

664
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:25,000
feel like I can do anything.

665
00:21:25,041 --> 00:21:27,500
Except find a place.

666
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,625
I can still crash here

667
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,625
for a few days, right?
