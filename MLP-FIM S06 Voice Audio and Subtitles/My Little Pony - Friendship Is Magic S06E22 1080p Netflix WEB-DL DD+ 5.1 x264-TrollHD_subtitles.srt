perfectly good hors d'oeuvre?

576
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,134
You also mentioned

577
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,134
the bubbling water.

578
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:00,056
And the swell.

579
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,183
Cucumber just happens

580
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:03,183
to be the favorite food

581
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:07,187
of the Tri-horned Bunyip. And

582
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:07,187
bubbles, followed by a swell

583
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,440
is what happens when they

584
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,440
swim up to the shallows

585
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,859
from deep water!

586
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:16,114
So, we attracted a tri-horned

587
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:16,114
whatchamacallit...

588
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,282
With cucumber

589
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,282
sandwiches?

590
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,159
Sounds like a stretch.

591
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,496
Hello, Bunyip, sir.

592
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:31,295
So that's a...

593
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:32,797
A Tri-horned Bunyip...

594
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,674
Who's very sorry

595
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:34,674
he accidentally

596
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,176
knocked over your

597
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,176
boat, right?

598
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,222
Wait; the storm had nothing

599
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,222
to do with the capsizing?

600
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:43,683
Nope.

601
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,644
All right. Even if our friend

602
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,644
the Bunyip is responsible

603
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:48,228
for sinking the boat,

604
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,231
that still doesn't excuse

605
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:51,231
a certain pony's behavior.

606
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,443
Me!? How about you

607
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,443
and Pinkie Pie?

608
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,779
Pfft! Wha-?! How- ME?--

609
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,322
[Twilight] I think I can

610
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,322
explain that too.

611
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,117
Each one of you spent so

612
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:01,117
much time trying to come up

613
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,910
with the perfect way

614
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,910
to get the others

615
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,745
out of their element,

616
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,745
that you didn't notice

617
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,580
your friends were

618
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:06,580
doing the same thing.

619
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:11,251
Wait a minute. You brought all

620
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:11,251
those games and things for us?

621
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,254
Of course! I figured the boat

622
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,254
trip was the perfect time

623
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,924
to do things that

624
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,924
were silly and fun.

625
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,343
And I was just trying

626
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:19,343
to give the two of you

627
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,180
the elegant cruise I

628
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,180
thought you deserved.

629
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,391
And I just wanted to give you

630
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,391
two a high seas adventure,

631
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,477
since that'd be something

632
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:28,477
new and different for y'all.

633
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:31,064
OOOOHHHHHHH.

634
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,273
That is so sweet.

635
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,359
You must have gone

636
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,359
through so much trouble.

637
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,486
Well, not half as much

638
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:37,486
trouble as you did

639
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:41,281
making all that fancy food.

640
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:41,281
And bringing all those games.

641
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,202
I guess this just teaches us

642
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:44,202
that even longtime friends

643
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,286
need to work at communication.

644
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,247
Well, there's something

645
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:48,247
I'd like to communicate

646
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:50,083
to you all right now.

647
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,794
You girls are the best friends

648
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,794
a pony could ever have.

649
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,338
Oh, let's never

650
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:56,338
fight again!

651
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,464
Agreed.

652
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:58,298
You've got it!

653
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,134

654
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,595
All right, you big

655
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,595
softy. Bring it in.

656
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,311
Come on, Bunyip,

657
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:11,311
sir. You've got it!

658
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:18,318
♪♪

659
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,447
One thing's for sure, Spike.

660
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,324
There's nothing like a

661
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,324
luxurious adventure boat party

662
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,285
to get you out of your element.

663
