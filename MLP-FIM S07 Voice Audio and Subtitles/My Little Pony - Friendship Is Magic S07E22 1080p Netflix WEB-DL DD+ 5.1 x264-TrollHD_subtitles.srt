00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:58,770
entirely honest of you to offer

00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:01,022
this cruise to my family

a quality vacation experience,

263
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:27,674
but if Twilight Sparkle and

264
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:27,674
her family don't want it,

265
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,427
Iron Will can cancel the cruise

As much as I want

272
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,357
a family vacation,

273
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,276
I don't think I could entertain

274
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,276
all these cruise ponies.

275
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:49,321

00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:53,367
I guess we were just so excited

278
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:53,367
by the idea of a family cruise.

279
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:58,205
[sigh] All right, I guess we

280
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:58,205
better turn this ship around.

281
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,251
Wait! Iron Will, what if

282
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,251
I offered you a deal?

283
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,587
If I agree to do whatever

284
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:06,587
princess activities you want,

285
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,964
will you promise

286
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,964
that my family

287
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,300
gets to do the

288
00:09:08,006 --> 00:09:10,300
activities they want?

00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,386
Sis, you don't

290
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:12,386
have to do that.

We want you to

292
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,179

297
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,895
forward to seeing us.

298
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,399
So what do you say, Iron

299
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:25,399
Will? Do we have a deal?

300
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,984

What did you say?

346
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,989
Uh... he... He said to

Did you get that one, Dad?

353
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,469
Can anypony tell me

354
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,469
how my dad is doing?

favorite time of day.

Ha ha. And it's

363
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:30,231
also your name.

364
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,859
Ha ha. I just thought

365
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,859
that was cool.

tiny boat race of your life!

371

Are you sure you're not

372
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:47,248
air-sick, Big Brother?

373
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,583
No way.

374
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,210
How can I be air sick?

375
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,004
I'm in the water, so

376
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,004
it totally cancels out.

377
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:59,093
I don't think that's how it

378
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:59,093
works, but I'm ready if you are!

00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,888
TECHNICALLY, PRINCESS TWILIGHT

380
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,888
SPARKLE SHOULD OFFICIATE

381
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,390
THE PRINCESS PADDLE BOAT RACE.

382
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:08,853
Well, I suppose I could

race your brother.

384
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,605
