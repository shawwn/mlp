You were right to be concerned.

Manes are tricky I have learned.

Tell me about it.

199
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,198
Cleaning is simple

200
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,198
but a magical fix,

201
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,159
could cause any number

202
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,159
of troublesome tics.

203
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:50,493

Oooh.

00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,414
There are tales I could tell to

00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,414
make your hair stand on end,

207
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:59,294

that spreads friend to friend,

216

I nearly forgot,

231
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,872
of an earth pony who needed

232
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,872
to clean up her shop.

what I have to do.

Perhaps it'd be better

Gee, Zecora, I can

00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,761
take a hint.

242
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,224
With just a few drops,

00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,224
any mess you'll improve,

00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,394

00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,394
which you want to remove.

246
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,397
It won't be hard to focus on the

00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:03,108

only take a few drops,

252
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:11,783

chip in... just in case.

254
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,119
Remember to only focus

00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,119
on the party string.

Is that you, Rarity?

Why would you think to

point your hooves at me?

Let's just say I understand

00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,422
why your shampoo

hasn't made a splash

I shouldn't have bought flowers

578
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,033
without asking Spoiled

579
00:18:37,075 --> 00:18:38,868
what she likes.

580
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,412
Well, we don't have much left.

581
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:42,997
What does she like?

582
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,916
Um, purple?

583
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,417
[Rarity] I have a solution.

584
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:53,049
Rarity, that mane is-- Amazing!

585
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:57,219
Thank you, although I'm afraid I

586
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:57,219
missed my chance at Vanity Mare.

587
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,933
Which means I have quite a few

588
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:01,933
lavender arrangements to spare.

589
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,143
Is lavender purple?

590
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:13,069
The wind-swept look

591
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:13,069
is very last season.

592
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,237
Perhaps you could

593
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,237
set this up outside?

594
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,115
It's sure to draw

595
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,115
in the hoof traffic?

596
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,954
[exciting chatter]

597
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,129
Photo shoot or no, you

598
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,129
can always use a chaise.

599
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,924
Well, Rarity, if you wanted

600
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,924
to shine from the inside out,

601
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,718
I think this afternoon, you

602
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,718
became the brightest filly

603
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,929
in Equestria.

604
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:43,057
Oh, pshaw, Applejack, I'm simply

605
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:43,057
making up for all the time

606
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,768
I wasted feeling

607
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:45,768
sorry for myself.

608
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,148
I don't know why you were so

609
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:50,148
upset, your mane looks awesome!

610
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,900
I'm just glad that I have all

611
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,900
of you to remind me that

612
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,736
even if I accidentally use

613
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,736
magical remover potion

614
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,614
on my mane, I can look

615
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,614
good on the outside

616
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,075
as long as I feel good

617
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,075
on the inside.

618
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,162
How did you end up using remover

619
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,162
potion on your head anyway?

620
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,707
Pinkie!

621
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,917
If I had the remover

622
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,917
potion this whole time,

623
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,961
that means Pinkie

624
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,961
must have the--

625
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,755
WHHHEEEEEEEEE!!!

626
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,132
Shampoo.

627
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:17,967
Shampoo?

628
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,803
Wow, that explains why our manes

629
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,803
are all so bouncy and soft.

630
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,686
Uh, perhaps I'll fetch the

631
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:28,686
rest of that remover potion.

632
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,771
Great!

633
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,900
Hey! Is there something

634
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,900
different about you?

635
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:35,068
New hoof polish?

636
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,571
So you're sure?

637
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,989
You're sure it's

638
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:39,989
fully recovered.

639
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,533
Yes, Rarity, it's been months.

640
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,951
Your mane looks fine.

641
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,831
Ooooh, look!

642
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,959
It's the Most Beautiful Manes In

643
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,959
Equestria issue of Vanity Mare.

644
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,003
You should read it.

645
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,006
Oh, honestly, Pinkie,

646
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,006
after all I went through,

647
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm not sure it even matters

648
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:59,800
what mane graces the pag--

649
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,219
READ IT!

650
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,015
But I canceled the shoot.

651
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:08,976
We had a little talk

652
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:08,976
with Photo Finish.

653
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:12,021
And explained just how beautiful

654
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:12,021
we thought you were -

655
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,356
inside and out.

656
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,151
While you were shining

657
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,151
from the inside out,

658
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:21,321
Photo Finish took

659
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:21,321
a few pictures.

660
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,824
I don't know what to say.

661
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,702
Luckily, you don't

662
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,702
have to say anything.

663
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,329
Your style speaks for itself.

664
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,749
[laughter]
