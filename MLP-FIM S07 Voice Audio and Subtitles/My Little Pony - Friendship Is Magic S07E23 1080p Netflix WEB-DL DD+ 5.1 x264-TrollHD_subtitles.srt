00:05:39,798 --> 00:05:41,091
Thank you!

196
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,592
No way, check that out!

197
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,974
It's not even my birthday!

198
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,434
Oh, sorry, guess

199
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,434
it was nothing.

200
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:52,686
[slurp]

201
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,480
But that custard

202
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,480
was everything!

203
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,611
Have I ever really seen Rainbow

204
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,611
Dash eat one of my pies?

205
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,614
And do I always look when

206
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,614
somepony points behind me?

207
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,491
WHAT'S THERE?

208
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:07,742
Good one.

209
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,203
But I need answers!

210
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:13,414
<i>I've sent Rainbow Dash a pie</i>

211
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,209
<i>every month she's</i>

212
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,209
<i>been a Wonderbolt</i>

213
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,419
and you're telling me you've

214
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,419
never seen her eat one?

215
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,423
Affirmative...

216
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,135
or uh, negative.

217
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,428
I mean, she wasn't

218
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,428
seen eating one.

219
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,973
Hmm... interesting.

220
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,352
Very interesting.

221
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,270
Are we under investigation?

222
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,480
As chief detective

223
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:37,480
on the pie case,

224
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,774
I've labeled you all

225
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,774
ponies-of-interest

226
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,444
so it's best you tell

227
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:43,444
me everything you know.

228
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,863
Well, we have been

229
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,863
getting mysterious

230
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,949
monthly pie donations.

231
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,036
Would you be able to pick

232
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:51,036
these pies out of a line up?

233
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,208
I hear Rainbow Dash's

234
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,208
pet tortoise, Tank,

235
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,085
has been having

236
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,085
tummy troubles.

237
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,460
When did it start?

238
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,380
About a week ago.

239
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,465
Poor Tank had all the telltale

240
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,465
signs of sugar overload:

241
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,094
jittery shell, sleeplessness,

242
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,094
reptilian indigestion.

243
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,887
Hmm...

244
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,472
and this all happened the day

245
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,472
after I made Rainbow Dash a

246
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,184
"thanks-for-lending-me-your-

247
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,184
jacket" peach pie.

248
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:17,396
It seems the pieces of the

249
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:17,396
puzzle are plopping into place,

250
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,107
but the picture isn't pretty.

251
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,483
Note to self: P

252
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,483
alliteration pie.

253
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,444
Is that everything, Doctor?

254
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,820
Well, there's also this.

255
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,283
Interesting.

256
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,202
Did you have the lab analyze

257
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:32,202
the flavor of that pie?

258
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:36,790
No, but you know, Ms. Cheerilee

259
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:36,790
was in here not long ago.

260
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,834
The class hamster was

261
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:39,834
having similar symptoms.

262
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,920
Perhaps it's a pie pandemic!

263
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:43,380
Perhaps.

264
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,258
And I just might know

265
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:46,258
pony patient zero!

266
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,510
Dr. Fauna's right.

267
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,972
I do always have to remind

268
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,972
the foals and fillies

269
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,141
not to share the pies with

270
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,141
the class hamster.

271
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,517
Animals just can't

272
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,517
digest pony food.

273
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,518
Indeed.

274
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,188
But where do these

275
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,188
pies come from?

276
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,898
Well, they're from

277
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,898
Rainbow Dash!

278
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,524
She drops off her

279
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,524
"Day-after-Rainbow

280
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,986
Dash's-half-birthday"

281
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:05,986
pie every year.

282
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,529
Did you say the day

283
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,529
after her half birthday?

284
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,491
Very, very interesting.

285
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,203
Because I give her a pie on

286
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:15,203
her half birthday every year.

287
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,915
And I have a feeling

288
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:18,915
it's the same pie.

289
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,210
Well, wherever it comes from,

290
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,210
the students just love it.

291
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,545
I'm so glad.

292
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,257
At least I can be

293
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,257
sure somepony is.

294
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,096
She didn't eat the blueberry,

295
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,096
she didn't eat the banana,

296
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,474
she didn't eat the cream and

297
00:08:33,138 --> 00:08:35,474
she didn't eat the chocolate.

298
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,225
SHE DIDN'T EAT ANY OF 'EM.

299
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,478
WHY?

300
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,562
And don't tell me this

301
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,562
all just started recently;

302
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,149
it's been going on for years!

303
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:46,151
Cheerilee said so herself.

304
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:50,238
And if there's one thing I know,

305
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:50,238
you can't escape the truth!

306
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,580
[thunderclap]

307
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,582
Rainbow Dash doesn't like PIE!

308
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,544
AND SHE'S BEEN LYING TO ME

309
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:04,544
ABOUT IT THE WHOLE TIME!

310
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,298
AAAAHHHHH!

311
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,596
AAAAHHHHH!

312
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:16,556
Pinkie Pie?

313
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,099
Pinkie Pie?

314
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,936
Whoa!

315
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,604

316
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,107
Oh. Party Planning

317
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,107
Cave. Right.

318
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,609
You OK?

319
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,611
Or are you just

320
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,611
screamin' for fun?

321
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,614
Screaming is fun,

322
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,614
but I'm not OK.

323
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,616
I've been making Rainbow

324
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,616
Dash pies for years,

325
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,993
but she doesn't

326
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,993
even like them!

327
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,454
She's been lying to me!

328
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:41,540
But, everypony loves your pies!

329
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,833
They're the greatest thing

330
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,833
since sliced apples.

331
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,628
Thank you!

332
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,628
And I could swear I've seen her

333
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,628
eat one of your pies before.

334
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,006
Have you really?

335
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:55,470
Um, I thought I had;

336
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:55,470
that's why I said it?

337
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:57,638
Are you sure?

338
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,392
Maybe I haven't?

339
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,642
Exactly!

340
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,562
Because it's all been a sham.

341
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,481
Rainbow Dash has been laughing

342
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:06,481
at my pies behind my back

343
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,983
and scheming of a way to get

344
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:08,983
rid of them for years!

that's what's happening.

I don't think

365
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,279
so either.

366
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:57,449
I know so.

Well, I've got just the

thing to get your mind off

all this madness.

We've had a great apple harvest

372

up a few of your delicious pies.

373
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,587
Yes, I will make

374
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:10,587
pies, lots of pies!

00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,715
it'll force her to

378
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,715
admit the truth,

379
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,052
or I'll catch her in the

act of getting rid of them.

you to come up with a plan.

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,697
you're lying about

581
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,741
that we should know?

582
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:55,783
No!

583
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,038
Well, not that I can think

584
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,038
of off the top of my head.

585
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,957
Is it MY fault that

586
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,957
I don't like pies?

587
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,210
And not just Pinkie's

588
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,210
pies, all pies.

589
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,713
I know how much she

590
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:08,713
loves making pies

591
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,299
and if I told her I didn't like

592
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:12,299
them, it would have crushed her.

593
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,219
Uh. You kinda

594
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:15,219
crushed her anyway.

595
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:19,473
Oh-- But I-- You're right.

596
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,143
I guess I should've just eaten

597
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:23,143
the pies in the first place.

598
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,521
Wait, that's it!

599
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,565
I know how I can

600
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:27,565
make it up to her!

601
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,155
Pee-yew! Gummy

602
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:35,155
is that you?

603
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,032
[knock]

604
00:18:36,074 --> 00:18:37,366
Huh. What is that?

605
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,079
Oh, it's<i> you</i> .

606
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,748
Pinkie Pie, wait.

607
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,584
I know now that I should've been

608
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,584
honest with you from the start

609
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,503
because lying to your

610
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,503
friends is wrong.

611
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,840
And because getting rid of all

612
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,840
those pies was a giant hassle.

613
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,009
I mean, do you have any

614
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,009
idea how many pies

615
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,803
you've made for me

616
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:56,803
over the years?

617
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,179
Yes, I know exactly how many.

618
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,767
I have a very detailed

619
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:02,767
pie-ling system.

620
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:04,477
Of course you do.

621
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,229
The point is, I thought

622
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:07,229
the hassle was worth it

623
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,274
just to spare your feelings,

624
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:10,274
but I was wrong.

625
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,736
So to make up for it, I

626
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:13,736
made this pie for you.

627
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,032
Well, I guess I made it for me.

628
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,450
To eat in front of you.

629
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:23,245
Point is, I'm eating

630
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:23,245
this pie for friendship!

631
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:28,042
Wait, that smelly circular

632
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:28,042
monstrosity is a pie?

633
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,293
Yeah!

634
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,211
I know I can't go back and eat

635
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:31,211
all the pies you made for me

636
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,589
in the past, so instead

637
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,216
I'm going to eat this

638
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,216
giant one for you now.

639
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:39,219
So here I go.

640
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:44,017
[splat]

641
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,685
Wait! I can't watch you do this.

642
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,647
[clattering]

643
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,566
I mean, is that crust or

644
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,566
some kind of concrete?

645
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,986
Yeah, honestly, I have no idea.

646
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,529
Oh, I can't believe

647
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:56,529
you're willing to eat

648
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,531
this terrible pie for me.

649
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,909
It's ridiculous and this whole

650
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,909
thing is overly complicated

651
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:06,164
and I think I finally

652
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:06,164
understand why you lied.

653
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,414
Whoa, what's that?

654
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,878
Huh. Guess it was nothing.

655
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,587
I'm so glad you enjoy my pies!

656
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,176
Oh, never mind.

657
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,136
Great pies!

658
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:22,096
EEEEEE!

659
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,430
No way, check that out!

660
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:28,268
It's not even my birthday!

661
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,939
Oh, sorry, guess it was nothing.

662
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:35,317
But that custard was everything!

663
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,112
Seeing you eat my pies makes

664
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,112
me the happiest pony

665
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,281
in all of Equestria!

666
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,826
I know it does.

667
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,747
You did a lot of ridiculous and

668
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,747
overly complex things to get rid

669
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,709
of my pies because it made

670
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:51,709
you happy to see me happy.

671
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,545
Just like I went to a lot of

672
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,545
effort to make you the pies

673
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,381
because it made me

674
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:57,381
happy to see you happy.

675
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:59,217
Yes!

676
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,301
And if you're willing to

677
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,301
go through all of that,

678
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:06,265
it really shows how much you're

679
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:06,265
willing to do for your friends.

680
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,893
Aw shucks, it was nothing.

681
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,937
Now get out of that

682
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,937
thing and give me a hug!

683
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,318
Just remember, in the future you

684
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:18,318
can always be honest with me.

685
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,695
I could've told her that.

686
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,530
[grunts]

687
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,074
Cool.

688
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:27,120
How 'bout this: Your

689
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:27,120
hugs are too tight.

690
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:28,121
Ha ha ha ha!

691
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,372
Ha ha ha!

692
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,372
No they're not.
