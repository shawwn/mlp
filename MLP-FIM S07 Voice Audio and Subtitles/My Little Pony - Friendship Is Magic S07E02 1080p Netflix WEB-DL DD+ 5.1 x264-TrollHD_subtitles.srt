I don't understand why

595
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,849
you could get me in

Twilight's never going

600
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,269
to trust me again.

601
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,771
And the worst part is

602
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,231
you didn't even

603
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,231
say you were sorry!

604
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:32,236
I... I'm sorry. I had no

605
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:32,236
idea you felt that way.

606
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,572
Yeah. I do.

608
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,577
But to be fair, I don't know

609
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,577
how you could have known.

610
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,080
I did a spell. I

611
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,080
bottled up my anger,

612
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,708
but when the bottle broke,

613
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,708
it infected these three.

614
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,505
I'm really sorry; I used magic

615
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,505
so I wouldn't use magic.

616
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,883
I should have guessed

617
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:53,883
that would backfire.

618
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,177
Oh, that's all right.

619
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:57,177
It was a slow day.

620
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,180
Yeah. I was gonna get
