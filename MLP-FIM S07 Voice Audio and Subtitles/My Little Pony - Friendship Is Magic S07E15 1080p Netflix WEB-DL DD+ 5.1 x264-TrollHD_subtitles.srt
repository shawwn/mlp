Reason number one:

30

32
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:49,800

00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,365
You're making weird noises.

197
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,576
Do you have a stomach ache?

198
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,662
I think I feel one coming on.

199
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,250
Well, you know what us dragons

200
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,250
say: push past the pain.

201
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:35,085
Now let's go!

202
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,004
Or we could stay here.

203
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,588
Or I could go without you.

204
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,342
Heh heh heh. Ah.

205
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,342
I like her.

206
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,393
Good, they're not here.

207
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,478
What was that?

208
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,233
Uh, I... I said, it's

209
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,233
all clean in here!

210
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,404
You must be hungry

211
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,404
from your travels.

212
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,283
Please, I'd love to present

213
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:06,283
you with an official

214
00:06:06,325 --> 00:06:07,366
Friendship Welcome Banquet.

[chomping]

216
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,378
So this is something friends do?

217
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,422
I could get used to this.

218
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,259
Actually that's

219
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,259
not food.

220
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,927
Dragons love gems.

221
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,595
Fine, but you're telling

222
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,595
Twilight what happened

223
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,223
to her wall.

224
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,434
Just keep her here.

225
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:38,481
OK, yeah, enjoy

226
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:38,481
all the crystal... things.

227
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,359
Where are you going?

228
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,986
I thought this was an

229
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,986
official friendship banquet.

230
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,403
Just gotta use the

231
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,403
little dragon's room.

232
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,409
So this is my comfy chair

233
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,409
for fictional reads.

234
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,332
This is my studying chair

235
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,001
because the hard

236
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:58,001
back keeps me awake.

237

00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,340
Oh, Spike! I'm so

239
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,340
glad you're here.

240
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,301
This castle visit

241
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:06,301
is getting weird.

242
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:08,427
Twilight really likes chairs.

243
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,058
What happened to the ice cream?

244
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,477
What? Oh, right!

245
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,477
Uh, they ran out.

246
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,814
Hey, I'm really sorry, but I

247
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,814
gotta borrow Twilight quickly.

248
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,236
[crash]

249
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,486
Be right back!

250
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,322
But we didn't get to talk yet!

251
00:07:27,364 --> 00:07:28,448
[groan]

252
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,993
Ember's here!

253
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,413
I know; I saw you coming

254
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:34,413
and had to distract Thorax

255
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,164
by showing him chairs!

256
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,209
Why did you bring Ember to

257
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,209
the castle of all places?

258
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:40,501
I don't know!

259
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,130
Ember was asking for you, Thorax

260
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,130
wants to talk with me...

261
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,631
we need to switch places!

262
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,301
They might be

263
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,301
getting suspicious!

264
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,470
All we have to do is make both

265
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,470
Thorax and Ember feel special

266
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,513
and keep them apart

267
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:52,513
for a few more hours.

268
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:54,015
We can do this.

269
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:58,019
Ah! What's happening?

270
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,526
I think it's the map!

271
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:05,526
It's calling... you!

272
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,529
Apparently, you also have to

273
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,529
solve a friendship problem.

The map is calling me?

Amazing, the map is

277
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:22,252
really reaching out.

278
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,212
Not a good time,

279
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,212
I get it.

280
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,713
Spike, are you here?

00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,258

I KNOW!

288
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,690
At least your friendship

289
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,690
problem is in Ponyville?

290
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,318
OK, OK, to pull this

291
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,318
off, I'm going to need

292
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,028
both of you to help.

293
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:48,862
You two need to keep

Ember and Thorax

get ice cream.

Yes.

00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,203
Go easy on me.

00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,537
I'm under a lot

strawberry cream is overused!

Ponyville so far?

Well, I'm certainly learning

325
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,502
a lot about friendship.

326
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,628
I had no idea it was polite

327
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,628
to decorate your walls

328
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,089

I show you around town?

337
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,648
Sounds good.

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,650
I can't exactly learn

339
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,650
about friendship

340
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,069

boring official paperwork

348
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,587

you and I get to hang out.

talk with Spike.

He said he'd be right back.

00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,677
He will, but first how

355
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,677
about we grab a bite to eat?

356
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,265
You know, now that you've said

357
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,265
it, I am a little hungry.

358
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:41,682

NO!

362
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,606
that's castle food.

never let cupcake flavors

get in the way of

369
00:10:56,615 --> 00:10:58,699
your friendship.

out of the castle.

382
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,726

a really, really great idea.

Sure.

thank you for having me over.

389
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,448
I'm in a bit of a

390
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,448
leadership pickle

391
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,949
and I could use

392
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,949
some advice.

393
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,745
Well, I definitely want to help

394
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,745
you out as quickly as possible.

395
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,748
Here's my problem: there's this

396
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,748
renegade group of changelings

397
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,750
who still feed off of love.

398
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,338
Even though I said, "Hey, let's

399
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:53,338
not do that anymore," they say,

400
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,340
"Hey this is how we've

401
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,340
been doing things

402
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,841
for hundreds of years."

403
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,759
but it's like they don't

404
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,759
want to even though

405
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,220
I'm the leader and I

406
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:00,220
asked politely...

407
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:08,936
[interested chatter]

408
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,605
Hello.

409
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,234
I am Ember, daughter of Torch,

410
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:14,234
winner of the Gauntlet of Fire

411
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,236
and lord of all dragons!

412
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,736
[whoosh]

413
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,781
[screams]

414
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,784
Usually when I do that, the

415
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,784
dragons are eager to meet me.

416
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,580
That's not how

417
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,580
ponies make friends.

418
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,789
Ahh, I get it.

419
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,379
This is a weird friendship

420
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,379
thing you ponies do, right?

421
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:35,796
[splat]

422
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,472
Uh... you guys

423
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,472
are in town, too?

424
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,806
What are you

425
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,806
talking about?

426
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,684
You've been with

427
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,684
me this whole time.

428
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,436
No, I'm Starlight.

429
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:53,814
Riiiiight.

430
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,816
I'm sorry, but you

431
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,816
can't blame me.

432
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,860
You both look and

433
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,860
act so much alike.

434
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,862
What?

435
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,408
And they said to me just

436
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:03,408
keep saying the same thing.

437
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,620
You know I think my leadership

438
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:06,620
problems started in childhood.

439
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,829
I must've been three when...

440
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,829
Three's a different story--

441
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,206
and you definitely

442
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,206
gotta hear it,

443
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,460
but the story about my

444
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,460
brother was when I was two...

445
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,793
Or was I one?

446
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:15,836
This is my seat!

447
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,879
I saw it first.

448
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,757
Well, I got here first.

449
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,800
Thorax, excuse me for a second.

450
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:26,847
Ponies, please.

451
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,809
If I may, I think I can help

452
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,809
solve this friendship problem.

453
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,981
You two should sit together.

454
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,024
You both like the same place;

455
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:37,024
you both ordered muffins;

456
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,109
you're both ponies.

457
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,860
I think if you made

458
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,860
a little effort,

459
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,655
you'd find that you

460
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,655
have a ....whoa!

461
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,865
OK, that had to have done it.

462
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,493
Come on spikes, glow.

463
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,872
Hey, that was

464
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,872
really great advice.

465
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,832
So what do you

466
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,832
think I should do?

467
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,671
[gasp]

468
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,964
Actually, I uh need a minute.

469
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,802
Alone. To really come

470
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:03,802
up with great advice.

471
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,969
I'll be right back!

472
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,347
Great. No problem.

473
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,889
Leave me again...

474
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,058
It's fine.

475
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,523
I'm just saying, you're both

476
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,523
purple ponies with purple hair.

477
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,984
You both have cutie marks

478
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,984
with sparkle-y things.

479
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,945
Mine's more of

480
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,945
a glimmer!

481
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,365
How is that different?

482
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,033
Oh, good, Spike.

483
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,577
Can you please tell

484
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,577
these two I'm right?

485
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,705
They look very similar.

486
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,999
Well, you know, one thing

487
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,999
friends do is let something go

488
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,460
when it's upsetting

489
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:37,460
somepony else.

490
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:38,919
But I'm right.

491
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,922
Besides, who are you to be

492
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,922
telling me about friendship?

493
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,384
I've barely seen

494
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,384
you all day!

495
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,927
I've seen you...

496
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,680
Are you calling me a liar?

497
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,684
Hey! No one yells

498
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,684
at my friend!

499
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,395
[roar]

500
00:14:57,856 --> 00:14:59,399
[crash]

501
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,609
Spike, get away from the bear!

502
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,863
Actually the bear's a changeling

503
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,863
and he's quite gentle.

504
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,406
Not anymore!

505
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,866
[roar]

506
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,785
Ahh!

507
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,627
My worst fears are happening!

508
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:20,795
♪ [dramatic music] ♪

509
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,925
♪♪

510
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,135
No!

511
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,471
Back away, Spike, I'm not

512
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,471
going to let this dragon

513
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:32,473
harm a scale on your back!

514
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,976
You back away! I'm not

515
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,976
going to let you harm him!

516
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,480
Wait, did you say you're not

517
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,480
going to let me harm Spike?

518
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:40,481
Yeah!

519
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:41,941
But that's what I'm doing.

520
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:43,984
What?

521
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,945
Yeah, what?

522
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,615
Equestria as we know it is over!

523
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,116
The war that pits

524
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,116
changeling against dragon

525
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:51,576
is about to begin!

526
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:52,993
And it's all my fault!

527
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,289
My title of Equestria's

528
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:56,289
Friendship Ambassador is a lie--

529
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,999
Oh. Hey. You guys

530
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,999
aren't fighting?

531
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,001
Why would we be fighting?

532
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,003
Because I accidentally

533
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,003
invited you both

534
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,882
over to Ponyville

535
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,882
on the same day?

536
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,008
[Both] So what?

537
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,011
So, I was trying

538
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,011
to keep you apart,

539
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,097
because I didn't

540
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,097
think you'd get along.

541
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:16,851
Oh, I get it.

542
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,353
You thought he wouldn't like me

543
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:19,353
just because I'm a dragon

544
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,481
and I'm bad at friendship?

545
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,024
No! No! Of course not! But...

546
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,903
Wait, isn't that

547
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,903
why you're here?

548
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,615
I can say I'm bad at friendship;

549
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:30,615
you can't say it about me!

550
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,784
You know what? I don't

551
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,784
want to talk about it.

552
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,786
Wait, please...

553
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,371
[sigh] I'm sorry.

554
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,165
No, no. It's cool.

555
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,584
You thought I'd be too soft

556
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,584
and someone like Ember

557
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,921
would never respect me, just

558
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:44,921
like my own changelings.

559
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:46,255
No, that's not it!

560
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,090
Thorax! Wait!

561
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,884
Oh, no.

562
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,302
What have I done?

563
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:54,013
[splash]

564
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:02,396
Why are you still here?

565
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:06,526
[sigh] Because I'm having

566
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:06,526
trouble leading my pack.

567
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,111
So I don't really

568
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,111
want to go home.

569
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,656
Wait, you're in charge?

570
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,951
Ho boy, you need to

571
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,951
be more assertive.

572
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:18,245
That's my problem,

573
00:17:14,993 --> 00:17:18,245
I don't know how.

574
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,415
I tried asking them to please

575
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:21,415
follow my directions

576
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,083
and I even offered

577
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,083
a prize and--

578
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,044
SHH! Stop talking.

579
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,756
That's how you do it.

580
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,551
Whoa. That just

581
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,551
gave me chills.

582
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,093
I know you have

583
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,093
it in you.

584
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,805
You turned into a

585
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,805
bear to defend Spike.

586
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,516
I guess I can be tough when

587
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:38,516
I'm defending my friends.

588
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,396
But when I'm just enforcing my

589
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:43,396
rules, I feel unsure of myself.

590
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,398
There's nothing to

591
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,398
be unsure of.

592
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,525
You're the leader

593
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,525
for a reason.

594
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,443
Make a decision and

595
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,443
let it be known

596
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,487
that the decision is final.

597
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,740
And if that doesn't

598
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,740
work, turn into a bear.

599
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,157
[chuckle]

600
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,576
That's good advice.

601
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,160
I know it is.

602
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,120
So what's your deal?

603
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,122
Why do you think you're

604
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,122
so bad at friendship?

605
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,833
I don't want to

606
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,833
talk about it.

607
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,501
Oh, you have to.

608
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,169
How else are you gonna

609
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,169
solve your problems?

610
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,425
Through feats of strength

611
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,425
and fire duels, of course.

612
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,134
Hiyah!

613
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,303

Uh... how did that help?

616
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,351
Crushing another

617
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,351
dragon in competition

618
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:26,146
establishes my dominance

619
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:26,146
and makes me feel great!

620
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,025
Right, but how do

621
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:29,025
you think they feel?

622
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,860
Humiliated! Ashamed!

623
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,153
They probably want to run

624
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,153
away and bury themselves

625
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,739
under a rock and...

626
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,323
...never come out.

627
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,158
They're probably sad.

628
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,535
Kinda low.

629
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,537
Definitely not happy.

630
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,665
That's because that kind of

631
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,665
competition can divide you.

632
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,918
And it doesn't get to

633
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,918
the heart of the issue.

634
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,004
Talking about your

635
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,004
feelings does.

636
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,047
Achoo!

You know you don't have to  be

sappy or huggy-feely about it,

642
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,058
but you should let your

643
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,058
friends know how you feel.

644
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,935

00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,935
we can start.

tell you how I feel

673
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,444
because my friend, Thorax said

674
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:55,444
it would make me feel better.

00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:57,030
