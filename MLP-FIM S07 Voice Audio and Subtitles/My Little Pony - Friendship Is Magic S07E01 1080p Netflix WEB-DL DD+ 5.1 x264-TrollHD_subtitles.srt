00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:01,486
I'm nosey and I want to hear.

197
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,571
OK. Would you

198
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,571
excuse me?

199
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,573
[zap]

200
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,201
Never mind.

201
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:08,327
What's going on?

202
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,745
Well, Twilight was

203
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,745
just about to reveal

204
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,915
her grand master

205
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,915
plan for you.

206
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,834
Really? I was kind

207
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,834
of wondering

208
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,418
what we were going

209
00:06:15,876 --> 00:06:17,418
to do next.

210
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,422
Yes, I'd say we were

211
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,422
both fairly interested.

212
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:26,345
Of course you are. And I

213
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:26,345
do have a plan, obviously,

214
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,429
but now's clearly not

215
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,429
the time to do it.

216
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,431
You should enjoy your party.

217
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,808
Starlight, come on!

218
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,186
The Ponyville Chronicle

219
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,186
wants to take our picture!

220
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,563
Ugh. You too,

221
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:36,563
Discord.

222
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:39,566
[sigh]

223
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:40,734
[poof]

224
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,944
PSST. I see what you're doing.

225
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,403
You do?

226
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,823
You already planned

227
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,823
the perfect moment

228
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,743
during the party to make

229
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,743
the grand announcement

230
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,287
to everypony

231
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,287
about your plan!

232
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,249
Brava, Twilight.

233
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,458
I can't wait to tell

234
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:57,458
Fluttershy and the others!

235
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,752
Discord, no.

236
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,386
Twilight? Are you reading

237
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:07,386
during a party again?

238
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,554
No, no, no. She's

239
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,554
already good at that.

240
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,016
She mastered this. She

241
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,016
taught me about this one!

242
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:15,310
Wild guess: something's wrong.

243
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:17,645
Spike, I'm a terrible mentor.

244
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,023
Why didn't I come up with

245
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,023
a path for Starlight?

246
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,609
Princess Celestia had it

247
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:22,609
all figured out for me.

248
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,444
[gasp] That's it!

249
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,824
I had years' worth

250
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,824
of friendship lessons

251
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,243
ready to go,

252
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,869
but when we were

253
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:32,869
captured by Chrysalis,

254
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,496
Starlight took charge

255
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,496
and really stepped up.

256
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,915
I don't think

257
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,915
friendship lessons

258
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,000
are enough for

259
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:39,000
her anymore.

260
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,503
So you have an overachieving

261
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:42,503
student? Sounds familiar.

262
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,007
That's why I had

263
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,007
to talk to you.

264
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,051
You of all ponies

265
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,051
would know what to do.

266
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,678
I mean, you were me

267
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,678
and I was Starlight.

268
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,223
But for now, I need you to

269
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,223
pretend you're you and I'm me.

270
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:54,515
Huh?

271
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,101
Go on.

272
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,478
When I was your student

273
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:58,478
and you were in this place,

274
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,649
you... oh no. You

275
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:02,649
sent me to Ponyville.

276
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,359
Which means, it's

277
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,359
time for me

278
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,860
to send Starlight

279
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,860
Glimmer away!

280
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,658
I can't believe it.

281
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,287
It really is time for

282
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,287
Starlight to go, isn't it?

283
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,039
Only you can make

284
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:18,039
that decision.

285
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,376
It's a difficult one, but your

286
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:21,376
heart knows what's right.

287
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,628
Even as it hurts.

288
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,046
Where are you going

289
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,046
to send her?

290
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:28,549
Too soon?

291
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,844
No. This is something

292
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,844
I have to do.

293
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:35,556
Oh, boy.

294
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,558
Oh, boy?

295
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,519
Whatever Twilight's

296
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,519
planning for Starlight

297
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,896
is going to be

298
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,896
so exciting!

299
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,400
Hm. Wonder why she didn't

300
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,400
tell any of us about it?

301
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,528
Probably because you're not as

302
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,528
close as you think you are.

303
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,741
Just kidding. She wanted

304
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:53,741
it to be a big surprise.

305
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,869
Just between us,

306
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,869
she's getting ready

307
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,538
to make a big

308
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,538
announcement!

309
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,999
Eeeee. That's so

310
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,999
exciting! And surprising.

311
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,583
Usually you tell

312
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,583
your party planner

313
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,378
about all your plans

314
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,378
for your party.

315
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,004
[Rainbow Dash] Well, she

316
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,004
definitely has one.

317
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,548
I mean when has

318
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,548
Twilight not had a plan?

319
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:15,138
[mumbling] Hm,

320
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:15,138
gosh, I don't know.

321
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,891
[gasp] I GOT IT! Since

322
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,891
defeating Chrysalis,

323
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,600
Starlight's given

324
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,600
the changelings

325
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,686
an opportunity to

326
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,686
revolutionize their society.

327
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,522
Maybe I can send her there.

328
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,689
[whoosh]

329
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:31,612
Cool spell.

330
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,614
If Starlight goes to

331
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:33,614
the changeling hive,

332
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,159
she can help them adjust

333
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,159
to their new way of life.

334
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,619
OK, friendship one-oh-one:

335
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,622
Thorax and I are going to

336
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,622
show you how to compromise.

337
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,626
I want to have honeysuckle

338
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,626
nectar for lunch.

339
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:50,006
I would like a sandwich.

340
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:50,006
Oh, no. What should we do?

341
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,717
Attack! The winner

342
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,717
gets to choose!

343
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,636
[excited chatter]

344
00:09:55,678 --> 00:10:00,058
OR, Thorax and I can

345
00:09:55,678 --> 00:10:00,058
talk about it and come up

346
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,643
with a solution that

347
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,643
works for everypony.

348
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,938
Starlight. How do

349
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:04,938
you feel about

350
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,567
honeysuckle and peanut

351
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:08,567
butter sandwiches?

352
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,570
Why, that sounds

353
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:11,570
delicious.

354
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,113
Compromise!

355
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,742
[chatter]

356
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,827
Um, this doesn't

357
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:19,827
seem like something

358
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,871
Starlight and

359
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,871
Thorax would do.

360
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,374
Uh, this is Twilight's

361
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,374
fantasy, Spike.

362
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,501
There is no wrong

363
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,501
way to fantasize.

364
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:28,044
Thank you.

365
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:32,173
Starlight Glimmer is a most

366
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:32,173
apt and perspicacious pony!

367
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,302
Yep, definitely a

368
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:35,302
Twilight fantasy.

369
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,054
This seems like a lovely

370
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:38,054
path for Starlight.

371
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,973
The Changelings have

372
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,973
so much to learn

373
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,767
about how to enjoy love

374
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,767
through friendships.

375
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,686
Starlight would be busy

376
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:45,686
for a very long time,

377
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:50,400
but her work there

378
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:50,400
would be very rewarding.

379
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,027
Or dangerous. It would

380
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:53,027
only take one Changeling

381
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,529
to deviate from the pack.

382
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:02,245
[evil laugh]

383
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:08,042
Hi, I'm Starlight Glimmer.

384
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:08,042
What's your name?

385
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,919
Uh, Cornicle?

386
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:14,341
PFFFT! HA! What kind

387
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:14,341
of name is that?

388
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:19,720
Your wings are so

389
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:19,720

00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:22,876
as I taught you.

585
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,920
I am embarrassed to admit

586
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,920
it, but I was afraid

587
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,048
if you made friends, you

588
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:29,048
wouldn't need me anymore.

589
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,094
Princess Celestia,

590
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:34,094
that is so not true.

I will always need you.

00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,725
I think Starlight Glimmer

593
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,725

595
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:41,394
what you're afraid of.

00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,604
Maybe it is.

00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,604
Just a little.

We are living proof

603
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:53,740
that letting someone
