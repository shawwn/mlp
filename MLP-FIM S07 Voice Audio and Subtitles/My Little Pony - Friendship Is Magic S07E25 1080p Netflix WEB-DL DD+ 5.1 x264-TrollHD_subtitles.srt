297
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,613

They did what now?

300
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,621
They used their magic to

301
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,621
open a portal between worlds,

302
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,291

303
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:43,291

307
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,259
Starswirl thought the only way

308
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:52,259
to trap the Pony of Shadows

309
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,635
in limbo was for the

310
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,635
Pillars to take him there.

311
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,638
So they got stuck too.

312
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,641
The Pony of Shadows must

313
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,641
have been really awful

314
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,727
for them to do that.

315
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,688
I suppose being trapped for all

316
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,688
time with a super-duper bad guy

317
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,567
in limbo might be OK if

318
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,567
you were doing the limbo,

319
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,859

I can get them out.

Opening portals between worlds

327
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,916

328
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,834
Are you sure it's safe?

329
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,712
First of all, you opened

330
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,712
portals through time.

331
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,672
And second of all,

332
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,672
Starswirl wrote the spell

333
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,966
you used to do it.

334

If he'd been here, he

335

336
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,678
Equestria would be

338
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,680

339
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:42,683

all the Pillars, right?

341
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,145

342
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,145

343
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,729
That's the thing

344

345

347
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,401
It's in between, so

348
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,401
time stands still.

349
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,903
If we can pull them out, it'll

350

358

00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,176

585
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,012

I'm sure Starswirl and the

601
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:22,161
Pillars did the best they could

602
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,498
back then, but magic

603
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:25,498
has come a long way,

604
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,208
mostly because of

605
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,208
the work they did.

606
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,210
That's true. And you

Starswirl's spells.

610
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,507
Exactly.

611
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:39,679
But, then I messed with one and
