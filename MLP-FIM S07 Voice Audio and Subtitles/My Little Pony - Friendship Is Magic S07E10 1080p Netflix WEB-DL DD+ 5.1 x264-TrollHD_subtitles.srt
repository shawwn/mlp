197
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:26,743
I do!

198
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,870
But... the last time the

199
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,870
princesses fought,

200
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,581
Luna turned into Nightmare Moon

201
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,581
and Princess Celestia

202
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,792
had to banish her for

203
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:33,792
a thousand years!

204
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,836
That can't happen again.

205
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,171
Well, I can't do nothing!

206
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,173
The princesses aren't the

207
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:39,173
best at communicating

208
00:05:39,214 --> 00:05:40,048
with each other.

209
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,091
[gasp]

210
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,050
Sorry.

211
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,302
It's just you

212
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:43,302
said "princesses"

213
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,762
and "aren't the the best"

214
00:05:43,342 --> 00:05:45,762
in the same sentence

215
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,346
and it's making me nervous.

216
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,682
[clunk]

217
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,142
I'm not much help, am I?

218
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,268
No!

219
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,023
Wow, I almost feel

220
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:56,023
bad eating this.

221
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,356
It's adorable!

222
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,734
Like I said, I

223
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:59,734
enjoy this part.

224
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:05,866
Hi.

225
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,867
Princess Luna! Wait.

226
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,916
As you both know, the map

227
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:14,916
sent me here for a reason

228
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:19,004
and I think I've

229
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:19,004
found out what it is.

230
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,799
Really? Oh, that is

231
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,799
wonderful, Starlight.

232
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,051
What is it?

233
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,802
You two.

234
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,846
I beg your pardon?

235
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,846
Excuse me?

236
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,558
I think you're accidentally

237
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,558
hurting each other's feelings

238
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,143
without realizing it.

239
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,565
Princess Celestia, does it

240
00:06:35,354 --> 00:06:38,565
bother you that Luna never

241
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,736
notices the wonderful breakfasts

242
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:42,736
that you prepare for her?

243
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:46,907
Yes. It does.

244
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,702
Princess Luna, tell Celestia how

245
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,702
you feel about the fact

246
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,411
that she never

247
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:52,411
acknowledges the work

248
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,872
you put into

249
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,872
lining the hallway

250
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,456
with lavender every night.

251
00:06:55,498 --> 00:07:00,587
I... Well, it's not

252
00:06:55,498 --> 00:07:00,587
the best feeling.

253
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:05,217
I'm sorry I never noticed you

254
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:05,217
make fruit faces on pancakes.

255
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:06,593
But nights are long for me!

256
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,637
You might be a morning

257
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,637
pony, but I am half asleep!

258
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,723
You think I don't get tired?

259
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,683
I'm exhausted.

260
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,978
Oh, I apologize for not noticing

261
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:16,978
flowers in a wall sconce,

262
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,231
but by the time I get

263
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,231
to retire for the night,

264
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:20,857
I can barely see straight.

265
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,319
Even so, I still make

266
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:24,319
an effort to smile.

267
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,906
Like smiling is so hard!

268
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,867
I'm sure that's not what

269
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,867
Princess Luna meant to say.

270
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:32,660
Is that what "exhausts" you?

271
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,414
Smiling and being

272
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,414
adored by everypony?

273
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,832
And you have it so

274
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,832
much worse, do you?

275
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,584
You spend your evenings

276
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,584
flitting around

277
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,628
giving ponies

278
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,628
lovely dreams!

279
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,171
Oh, it sounds just awful.

280
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:45,340
OK.

281
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,593
I feel like we should step

282
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,593
back, take a deep breath...

283
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,888
Don't presume to know what it is

284
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:51,888
like to govern the dream realm!

285
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,808
And yet you know exactly

286
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,808
what it's like to be me?

287
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,351
Oh, please.

288
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,352
Enough!

289
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:59,062
[zap]

290
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:04,525
There!

291
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:09,156
Now you'll know exactly what

292
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:09,156
it's like to be each other!

293
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,240
[gulp]

294
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:17,331
What have you done?

295
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:19,666
I went with my gut?

296
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,960
Switch our cutie marks

297
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:21,960
back this instant.

298
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:22,961
My apologies,

299
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:22,961
Your Majesties.

300
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,131
But I can't, even

301
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,131
if I wanted to.

302
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,258
This spell lasts

303
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:28,258
twenty-four hours.

304
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,927
It may have been extreme, but...

305
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:33,888
I think it's still a good idea.

306
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,390
What?

307
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,557
You said it yourselves.

308
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,685
Neither of you believes

309
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,685
your sister knows

310
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,645
how hard it is to be you.

311
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,440
So this is your

312
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,440
chance to prove it.

313
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,069
Well, I could use

314
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:48,069
an easy day

315
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,904

316
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,904
night's sleep.

317
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,323
You can try.

318
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,409
I haven't had an easy

319
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,409
day in well, ever.

320
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:58,538
But now, I get to sleep and

321
00:08:54,451 --> 00:08:58,538
tonight will be a breeze.

322
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,248
All right, Starlight Glimmer.

323
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,582
We will do this.

324
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:02,583
Good choice.

325
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,584
Not that you had one.

326

[nervous giggle]

327
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,172
I'm gonna stop

00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,172
talking now.

The actual princesses'

332
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,306
cutie marks?

333
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,059
I thought we

334
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:19,059
moved past this!

335
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,520
It was the right

336
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,520

He's not the only one.

As you can see, Celestia and

346
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,205
I are switching places today.

347
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:43,624
Huh?

348
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,420
I assure you, I am more than

349
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,420
capable of handling

350
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:50,340
all of Celestia's

00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:36,279
in the White Tail Woods.

390
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,449
The nearby towns have been in

391
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:39,449
a state of panic for weeks.

392
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,201
But I have to fix this.

393
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,620
You can't.

394
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:47,165
You need to put on a brave

395
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:47,165
face and help these ponies.

396
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,459
It's what Celestia would do.

397
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,256
HELLO! GREAT NEWS!

398
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,133
THERE ARE NO TIMBERWOLVES!

399
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,680
There are definitely

400
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:01,680
timberwolves!

401
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,764
I'm sorry, but I

402
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,764
couldn't stop thinking

403
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,892
about those poor students!

404
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,603
Normally, I have all the time

405
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:08,603
and solitude I need

406
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,813
to work through my

407
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,813
problems at my own pace.

408
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,900
Well, your sister

409
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,900
doesn't get that luxury.

410
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:18,196
[arguing]

411
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,322
Ready for the

412
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,322
town hall?

413
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,450
[shouting]

414
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,622
Glad that's settled.

415
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,748
That only took

416
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,748
three hours.

417
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,376
That got heated

418
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,376
didn't it?

419
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,335
Still on for

420
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:32,335
golf?

421
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,794
Oh, absolutely!

422
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,796
You made it to the

423
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,796
end of the day!

424
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,048
Yay?

425
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:42,637
Hmm? Oh, yes I'm just

426
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:42,637
going to turn in then.

427
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,472
Goodlight, Starnight.

428
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,351
Oh, hello, Starlight!

429
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,812
I don't know about you, but

430
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:51,812
I feel very well-rested!

431
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,690
Where's Luna?

432
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,816
She already turned

433
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,816
in for the night.

434
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,818
Did she now?

435
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,448
It seems my duties were harder

436
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,448
than my sister expected.

437
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:07,828
Moon raised.

438
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,290
It's even easier

439
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,290
than raising the sun!

440
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,708
What's next?

441
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,294
[heavy breathing]

442
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,629
Of course.

443
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,631
Everypony's asleep at night.

444
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:19,716
Luna works alone.

445
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,842
Oh, but it's nothing

446
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,842
I can't handle!

447
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,262
All I have to do is

448
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,262
watch over Equestria,

449
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,930
visit the dream realm

450
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,930
and protect ponies

451
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:27,848
in their nightmares.

452
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,310
My list was three

453
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,310
times as long!

454
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,563
All right.

455
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,482
Everypony's asleep.

456
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,858
You're talking to

457
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,858
yourself, Celestia.

458
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,694
But there's nopony

459
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,694
else to talk to!

460
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:40,861
Yet.

461
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,947
I can talk to ponies

462
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,947
in their dreams!

463
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,874
Now to save some ponies

464
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,874
from their nightmares,

465
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,461
which aren't real so it

466
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,461
shouldn't be too hard, right?

467
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,837
Right. Good call, Celestia!

468
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,383
And I'm talking to myself again.

469
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:03,718

470
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:05,844

475
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,479
No!

476
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:16,939
This is big!

477
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:17,898
Like really big!

478
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,400
Wah!

479
00:14:19,442 --> 00:14:21,319
Starlight, I'm here now.

480
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,903
Tell me what's wrong.

481
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,699
Going with my gut

482
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:25,699
was the wrong call!

483
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,908
I was supposed to bring

484
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,908
you two closer together,

485
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,910
but I've only driven you apart!

486
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,996
If you two can't see why

487
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,996
you need each other, then...

488
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:33,873
Then I am back!

489
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,919
[nasty laugh]

490
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,421
Don't worry, Starlight.

491
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,718
I know how to handle

492
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:44,718
Nightmare Moon.

493
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:49,806
Yes, but can you handle me?

494
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:54,310

This can't be!

497
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,945
If Luna can turn

498
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,945
into Nightmare Moon,

499
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,949
you can absolutely turn

500
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:08,949
into me, Daybreaker.

501
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,953
The better, prettier and

502
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:12,953
more powerful version of you.

503
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:15,623
No. I'll never turn into you!

504
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,958
Deep inside you know

505
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,958
how powerful you are.

506
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,919
You don't need Luna.

507
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,047
That's not true.

508
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,966
Even when we were apart,

509
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,966
I knew I needed her.

Oh, please!

00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,681
You don't need anypony.

512
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,975
You can do whatever you want

513
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,975
and all you have to do

514
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:38,396
is get rid of anypony

banished you to the moon.

519
00:15:44,736 --> 00:15:46,987
I should have destroyed you!

520
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,782
No! You can't do that!

Equestria needs both of you.

Without balance,

there's no harmony!

00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,794
you can have it all?

00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,966
You can't get rid of
