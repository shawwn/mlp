For dinner! Not to babysit.

580
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:09,143
I'll have to check with Spike,

581
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:09,143
but I think we're free.

582
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,478
Where is Spike, anyway?

583
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,564
"...the dashing dragon warrior

584
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,275
breathed a scorching

585
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,275
flame from his snout

586
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,946
then chuckled to himself

587
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,946
as he flew into the sunset.

588
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,365
'If you can't stand the heat,

589
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,365
don't fight a dragon.'"

590
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,743
Hey, you kinda

591
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,743
look like him!

592
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:27,453
Thank you.

593
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,371
OK. Now who wants more cake?!

594
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,415
[cheers]
