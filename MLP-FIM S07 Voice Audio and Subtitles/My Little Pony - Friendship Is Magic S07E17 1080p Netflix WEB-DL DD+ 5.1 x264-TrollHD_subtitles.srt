00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,350
Pharynx dumped an entire

198
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,350
can of black paint on me!

199
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,063
He said my fuchsia color wasn't

200
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,063
"intimidating to our enemies."

201
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,439
What enemies?

202
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:16,566
I am so sorry.

203
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,152
I promise I'll

204
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,152
talk to him.

205
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,195
You're the ruler of

206
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:20,195
the hive, Thorax.

207
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,322
You need to do

208
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,322
more than talk!

209
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,827
Well? Maybe not everything

210
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,827
here is amazing.

211
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,453
Seriously, Thorax.

212
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:31,372
What is up with your brother?

213
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,209
[sigh] Pharynx used to

214
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,209
be Head of Patrol.

215
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,753
But now we're peaceful and

216
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:36,753
there's no need to patrol,

217
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,757
so he just stalks around the

218
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:40,757
hive making everyone miserable.

219
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,760
The other changelings are sick

220
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,760
of it and if I can't get him

221
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,181
to accept love and friendship

222
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:47,181
and change like the rest of us,

223
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,723
everything I've done

224
00:05:47,222 --> 00:05:48,723
here is at risk.

225
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:51,852
[negative] Uh huh!

226
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,020
[hopeful sound]

227
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,563
[sigh] OK.

228
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,399
We know a thing or two about

229
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:58,399
what it's like to be outsiders.

230
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,401
Maybe we could talk

231
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,401
to him for you.

232
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,196
Do you really

233
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,196
think you could help?

234
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,614
Thorax, if there's anypony

235
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:04,614
who can help your brother...

236
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:06,407
it's me.

237
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,411
And with Starlight helping, it

238
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:10,411
might take slightly longer,

239
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,247
but I guarantee

240
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,247
you we can do it.

241
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,248
[groan]

242
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,002
Thorax, we're ready to start

243
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,002
work on the trail of plants

244
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,419
to lead the Maulwurf away.

245
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,421
I have to head outside.

246
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,341
You're sure you're

247
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,341
OK handling Pharynx?

248
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,424
Absolutely!

249
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,510
[shouts]

250
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,642
Yeah. We totally

251
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,642
got this!

252
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,236
[grunts]

253
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,363
So. How do you

254
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:44,363
want to play this?

255
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,656
I'm thinking good

256
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,656
pony/bad pony.

257
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,284
You yell and blast

258
00:06:46,698 --> 00:06:49,284
him with magic,

259
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:53,454
while my natural charisma

260
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:53,454
will convince him that--

261
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,082
Starlight?

262
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,667
Hey, Pharynx.

263
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,338
I know when we first met,

264
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,338
it didn't go so well...

265
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,463
I put you in a bag.

266
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,757
I thought it went great.

267
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,467
Right. [ahem]

268
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,971
So... not a big fan

269
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,971
of the vines, huh?

270
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:11,472
They're a safety hazard.

271
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,184
An enemy could hide in them

272
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,184
or use them as weapons.

273
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,727
I don't even know

274
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,727
why they're here.

275
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,478
Because they're pretty?

276
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,939
That's ridiculous.

277
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,481
Totally.

278
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,317
We get you.

279
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,654
But maybe don't express how

280
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,654
you feel by destroying them?

281
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,489
I don't take advice

282
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,489
from ponies.

283
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,534
The only thing I take

284
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,534
from you is breakfast.

285
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,494
At least I used to.

286
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,330
You know, you're a

287
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,330
lot like us.

288
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:36,331
Doubt it.

289
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:38,917
It's true.

290
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,752
Do you know who

291
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,752
Twilight Sparkle is?

292
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:42,003
No.

293
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,298
Well, she's the most

294
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:44,298
well-liked, studious,

295
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,925
do-goodiest pony

296
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:46,925
in Equestria.

297
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,509
She sounds awful.

298
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,387
Oh, you'd hate

299
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,387
her. I used to.

300
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,389
She made me unsure about

301
00:07:50,429 --> 00:07:52,389
my place in the world,

302
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,515
which led me to act

303
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,515
out against her.

304
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,519
And I used to be a dictator who

305
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:58,519
ran a village with an iron hoof!

306
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,690
Really? Hmm. Maybe you

307
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,690
two do understand me.

308
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,734
Yes! We do!

309
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,529
But now, Trixie has come to

310
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:08,529
terms with being second-best...

311
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,574
And I no longer control

312
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,574
ponies against their will.

313
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,828
And our lives are so

314
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:14,828
much better for it.

315
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,539
Wow. So you're both losers.

316
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,584
Stay away from me or I'll do

317
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,584
to you what I did to the vines.

318
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:28,133
Well, operation Lead Maulwurf

319
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:28,133
away is coming along.

320
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,260
How'd it go with Pharynx?

321
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,930
Your brother is... um,

322
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:33,930
challenging.

323
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,390
That bad, huh?

324
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:36,724
It wasn't great.

325
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:38,226
You want to talk it out?

326
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,188
You can come with me

327
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:41,188
to the Feelings Forum.

328
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,357
The Feeling what, now?

329
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,567
It's a place for changelings

330
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:46,567
to express their feelings

331
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,737
so we all gain a better

332
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,737
understanding of each other.

333
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,199
It's really helped bring

334
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,199
the hive closer together.

335
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,412
Sometimes I feel like

336
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,412
I'm a blue changeling.

337
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,789
Sometimes I feel like

338
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,789
I'm a purple changeling.

339
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,583
But here I am,

340
00:08:59,831 --> 00:09:02,583
a green one.

341
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,003
You can be anything

342
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,003
you want to be.

343
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,214
Be blue one day and

344
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,214
purple the next.

345
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,757
Be both on the same day!

346
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,593
But then I feel like

347
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,593
I'd be living a lie.

348
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,597
It's very brave of you to

349
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:16,597
share something so personal.

350
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,018
Does anyone else have

351
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,018
similar concerns?

352
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,480
I used to, but craft time has

353
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,480
given me such a creative outlet

354
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,440
I feel great now.

355
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,067
Everyone loves craft time.

356
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,110
[chatter]

357
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,529
Well...

358
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,780
everyone except

359
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,780
for you-know-who.

360
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,950
Yeah. You-know-who spends all

361
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:35,950
his craft time making spears.

362
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,620
He's scary and intimidating.

363
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,831
You-know-who makes

364
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,831
me uncomfortable.

365
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,084
He makes us all

366
00:09:41,873 --> 00:09:44,084
uncomfortable!

367
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,878
Everyone, please, I

368
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,878
understand Pharynx

369
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,838
can be challenging

370
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,838
at times--

371
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,257
That's an

372
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,257
understatement.

373
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,467
He lined the

374
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,467
hallway with thorns!

375
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,470
He teaches little changelings

376
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:55,470
to growl and hiss!

377
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:56,679
My soup's too hot!

378
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:00,058
What?

379
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,643
I thought the Feelings Forum

380
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,643
was for sharing our problems?

381
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,855
It sounds like your lame

382
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,855
Feelings Forum is for talking

383
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,358
about me behind my back.

384
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,445
The Feelings Forum is for

385
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,445
talking about anything

386
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,154
that's bothering you.

387
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,074
Is there something you'd

388
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:16,074
like to share, Pharynx?
