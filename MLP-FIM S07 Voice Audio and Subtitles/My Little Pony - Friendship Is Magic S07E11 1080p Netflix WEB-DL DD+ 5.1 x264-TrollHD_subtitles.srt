391
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,417
So he asked the neighboring

392
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,417
town of uh, Bovineville

393
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:15,169
to come help them. Yeah! Cows!

394
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,463
The magical cows

395
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:16,463
helped the goats.

396
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,299
Everyone survived and

397
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,299
lived happily ever after.

398
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,885
Because they asked for help.

399
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:23,844
The end!

400
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,847
[shouting]

401
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,309
So what is the

402
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,309
moral of that story?

403
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,061
Is it A: asking for

404
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:32,061
help is OK?

405
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,523
B: asking for help

406
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:35,523
saves the day?

407
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,360
Or C: asking for help

408
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:39,360
is good for everypony?

409
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,529
D: goats weak

410
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,529
and horrible!

411
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,949
Magic Bovines need to stay

412
00:13:41,571 --> 00:13:44,949
out of goats' business!

413
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:48,035
Um... not quite.

414
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,622
Any-yak wanna shout

415
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,622
out another answer?

416
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:53,708
[whistling wind]

417
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,335
[groan]

418
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,256
[Pinkie] Hey,

419
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,256
Prince Rutherford.

420
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,760
I want to talk to you about

421
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,760
something -- what are you doing?

422
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,764
Yak snow bed got a

423
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:07,764
little melty last night.

424
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,557
OK, yeah.

425
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,726
That's what I want

426
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,726
to talk to you about.

427
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,771
You know, these yak snow

428
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:14,771
beds are the fluffiest

429
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:15,938
I've ever slept in!

430
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,190
They're so comfortable,

431
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,317
you forget that it's just

432
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,317
a cold block of ice.

433
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,069
And the yak snow

434
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:22,069
sandwiches, mmm, mmm!

435
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,863
I hate it when food

436
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,863
burns your mouth

437
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,990
or overwhelms

438
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,990
it with flavor.

439
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,702
Oh! Yak hates that too.

440
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,787
You know who would

441
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,787
really, really enjoy

442
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:32,539
these snow sandwiches?

443
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,874
Twilight Sparkle and

444
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,874
the other ponies!

445
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:38,586
Oh! Hey, I have an idea!

446
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,840
Why don't I go to Ponyville

447
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:41,840
and bring them back here?

448
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,175
Ponies like snow sandwich?

449
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,386
Ponies love snow

450
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,386
sandwiches!

451
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,095
And, hey, while they're here,

452
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,806
you can ask if they'll

453
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,806
clear the snow away.

454
00:14:49,848 --> 00:14:51,974
Fun, right?

455
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,519
When Prince was little yak,

456
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,146
Prince stomped on

457
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:57,146
ground too hard.

458
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,816
Made deep hole and

459
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:59,816
fell into hole.

460
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,068
Ice froze over hole.

461
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,406
Prince waved to friends and

462
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:06,406
family from inside frozen hole.

463
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,241
Waited for spring thaw.

464
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,785
Prince survived on own.

465
00:15:10,827 --> 00:15:12,286
Wait a minute.

466
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,831
You spent the whole

467
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:14,831
winter in a hole?

468
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,417
Yes. And yak never

469
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:17,417
ask for help!

470
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,547
OK, first of all, how did you

471
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,547
make such a deep hole

472
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:23,964
from stomping?

473
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,717
And how did it

474
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,717
freeze over so fast?

475
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,594
And how could you see

476
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,594
your family and friends

477
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,554
to wave to them from

478
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,554
inside a frozen hole?

479
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,056
Even if all that was possible,

480
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,056
how did you breathe in there?

481
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,727
YAKS DON'T ASK FOR HELP!

482
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,813
But the yaks are hungry!

483
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,899
And who knows when

484
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,899
the snow will melt?

485
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,483
I just don't

486
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,483
understand why--

487
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:47,488
Ah yes, is clear now that Pink

488
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:47,488
Pony does not understand Yaks!

489
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:50,157
Honorary Yak status rescinded!

490
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,370
Bang! Pretend there

491
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,370
is door!

492
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,205
I just slammed it!

493
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,166
Fine, be stubborn!

494
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,217
Those yaks are so stubborn.

495
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,720
They refuse to ask for help

496
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,720
even though they need it.

497
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,472
Well, this Official

498
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,472
Friendship Ambassador

499
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,849
is going to take matters

500
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,849
into her own hooves.

501
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,100
I'll show them.

502
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,146
You're right, Gummy.

503
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,355
I am too worked up.

504
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,692
A road trip game would

505
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,692
officially calm me down.

506
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:25,735
I know!

507
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,904
Let's play "Twenty

508
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,904
Million Questions."

509
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:29,029
You think of something.

510
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,824
Then I'll ask you twenty

511
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,824
million questions

512
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,033
until I can come up with

513
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:33,033
what you're thinking of.

514
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:33,993
Let's go!

515
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:34,828
Is it blue?

516
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:35,829
Is it green?

517
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,830
Is it red?

518
00:16:36,871 --> 00:16:37,831
Is it greenish-red?

519
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:38,706
Is it reddish-blue?

520
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:39,624
Is it bigger than a bread box?

521
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,249
Is it smaller than a bread box?

522
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:41,835
Is it a bread box?

523
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:42,836
Is it bread?

524
00:16:42,877 --> 00:16:43,711
Is it teeth?

525
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,045
Is it Granny Smith's dentures?

526
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,464
Is it you?

527
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:47,423
Is it a rooster?

528
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:48,549
Is it a red rooster?

529
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,677
Is it a red rooster eating corn?

530
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,220
Uhp, used up all twenty

531
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,220
million questions.

532
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,639
Oh, well, we're here anyway!

533
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,145
Official Pony

534
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,145
Balloon still here?

535
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,901
Pink Pony gone because Pink

536
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:06,901
Pony not tough like yaks.

537
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,821
Horn bump in agreement.

538
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:10,780
Now!

539
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,535
[chomp]

540
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:16,995
Bleagh!

541
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,079
Snow sandwich lose novelty.

542
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,999
Snow couscous for dinner.

543
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,000
[grunts]

544
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,920
Then Prince Rutherford

545
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,920
said -- Bang!

546
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,505
Pretend there is door!

547
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,215
I just slammed it!

548
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:29,966
Pinkie Pie--

549
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,509
So then Pink

550
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:31,509
Pony said --

551
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:33,970
Fine, be stubborn!

552
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,639
Pinkie Pie, we have

553
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:36,639
to help the yaks!

554
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,059
So in conclusion, we

555
00:17:36,681 --> 00:17:40,059
have to help the yaks!

556
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,394
Hmm?

557
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,354
Just go with it, hon.

558
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,939
Great idea, Pinkie.

559
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,816
We'll be happy to

560
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:46,816
help the yaks.

561
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,985
This is what friendship

562
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:48,985
is all about.

563
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,987
Hey! I'll bring

564
00:17:49,027 --> 00:17:50,987
apples.

565
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,573
This season's batch

566
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,573
are extra juicy.

567
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,033
And I shall provide the yaks

568
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,451
with Equestria's

569
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,451
finest textiles.

570
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,038
They'll be silky and

571
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,038
warm with hints of gold

572
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,330
to compliment their horns.

573
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,832
Stop!

574
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,251
We can't bring the

575
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,251
yaks any pony stuff.

576
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,669
Why not?

577
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:08,796
The yaks are very proud.

578
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,798
They won't ask for help.

579
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,384
You know what they say, you

580
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,384
can lead a yak to water,

581
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,762
but you better not let

582
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,762
him know you're doing it!

583
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,680
