I like your spirit!

196
00:05:59,943 --> 00:06:01,486
Uh huh! Oh yeah!

197
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,868
What about

198
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,868
this one?

199
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:13,456
Sea Pony etiquette isn't going

200
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:13,456
to help right now, Spike.

201
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,126
Uh, Twilight?

202
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,126
Are you OK?

203
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,879
I just unleashed ultimate

204
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:18,879
evil and doomed Equestria

205
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,714
because I was obsessed

206
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,714
with meeting my idol.

207
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,341
Why wouldn't I be OK?

208
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,466
[thud]

209
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,760
You didn't know that

210
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,760
was gonna happen.

211
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,055
But I should have listened to

212
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:28,055
you and left things alone.

213
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,183
Now the elements of harmony

214
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:31,183
will be lost to fix my mistake!

215
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:32,976
Maybe there's another way.

216
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,394
If there is, Twilight

217
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,394
will find it.

218
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,900
Portal gate... portal keys...

219
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,900
portal spells.

220
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,903
YES! If the Pillars can hold

221
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,903
open the gateway to limbo,

222
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,488
a powerful pony can do the

223
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,488
banishing spell herself!

224
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,074
Do you know what this means?

225
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,160
I can stop carrying books?

226
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,453
The Pillars don't have

227
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,453
to leave Equestria!

228
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,830
Even though we'll

229
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,830
lose the elements,

230
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,707
we'll have the ponies

231
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:55,707
that created them.

232
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,459
And the Pony of shadows

233
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,459
will be banished for good!

234
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,670
That's great.

235
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,006
But I was thinking

236
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:03,006
of another way

237
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,718
that maybe doesn't involve

238
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,718
"banishing" at all?

239
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,470
Starswirl knew what he was

240
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:09,470
doing when he cast that spell.

241
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,014
If I can make it

242
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,014
even better,

243
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,101
maybe he'll see that I take

244
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:14,101
magic as seriously as he does.

245
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:20,148

249
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,154
I bet the Pony of Shadows

250
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,489
would've loved the

251
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,489
Ghastly Caverns

252
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,491
before 1000

253
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,491
years of erosion

254
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,786
turned it into the

255
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,786
Ghastly Gorge.

256
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,581
The "Appeloosian Wastes" sure

257
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,581
sounded dark and desolate.

258
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,791
Who knew they would become

259
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,001
such a popular square

260
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,001
dancing destination?

261
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,462
And I get how this

262
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:42,462
part of Equestria

263
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,298
used to be cast

264
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,298
in eternal night

265
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,884
where the Pony of Shadows could

266
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,884
draw power and wreak havoc

267
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,388
while ponies were powerless

268
00:07:47,926 --> 00:07:51,388
to stop him, but,

269
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,764
it's kinda made a comeback.

270
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,641
Did I mention it's

271
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,641
really bright?

272
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,650
It seems there are fewer dark

273
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,650
corners in the realm these days.

274
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:05,402
Isn't that a good thing?

275
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,196
True. The Pony of Shadows

276
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,196
will have a hard time

277
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:09,530
regaining power.

278
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,118
When he rears his

279
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:13,118
head, we'll be ready!

280
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,289
Isn't there some way to banish

281
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,289
him without losing all of you?

282
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:18,999
I wish there were.

283
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,543
But to save our home, we

284
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,543
are willing to leave it.

My spell isn't finished yet,

00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,549
but I think we can send The

Pony of Shadows to limbo

290
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,510
without all of you

291
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,510
having to go as well!

292
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:36,016
While I appreciate your

293
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:36,016
enthusiasm, Twilight,

294
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,354
this is hardly the time to take

295
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:40,354

But Twilight doesn't

00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:54,159
finishing one of your spells.

304
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,119
I think you'll find her

00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,119

While it is an

00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,916
unconventional approach,

311

The Hollow Shades.

I think a branch of the

00:09:29,277 --> 00:09:31,988
Apple family lives there.

322
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,781
They'd have to be

323
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,781
pretty distant.

324
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,826
The Hollow Shades was

325
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:36,826
abandoned eons ago.

326
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,619
Hm, that's odd.

was Starlight's village.

330
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,420
So it's like a

331
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:46,420
super-villain tracker!

332
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,546
No offence.

333
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,090
Do you think the map could

be trying to tell us

335
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,591
where the Pony of Shadows is?

336
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,176
Hmmm.

Ready yourselves for battle.

345
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,110
but is banishment

346
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,110
really the only option?

347
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,153
I mean, it's been a long time.

348
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,574
Maybe the Pony of

Shadows is ready to talk?

350

Starlight, I'm sure Starswirl

354

and the others did try.

355
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,627
The Pony of Shadows was not

356
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,627
interested in reconciliation.

00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:40,515

but this whole

368
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:48,689
plan seems wrong.

369
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,026
The map's only ever sent us

370
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,026

doesn't really seem like the

00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,365
friendship type.

00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,408
