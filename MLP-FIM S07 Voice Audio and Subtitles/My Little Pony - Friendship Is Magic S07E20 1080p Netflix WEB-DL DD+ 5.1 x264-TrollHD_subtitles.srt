580
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,349
I didn't want it to

581
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,349
have to come to this

582
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,142
but I'll just have to use...

583
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,102
The Stare.

You really are

587
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,447
aggressive.

00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,008
What happened? Where am I?

591
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,801
I'm so glad you're OK!

592
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,720
You're still in

593
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,720
Meadowbrook's tree.

595
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:19,515
some magic up and caught ya.

596
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,059
It was crazy.

597
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,685
Goodness gracious!

Have you heard from Zecora?

600
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:27,648
Is she OK?

601
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,233
Uh...

602
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:33,320
We got word your zebra friend

603
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:33,320
has started sprouting leaves.

604
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,740
She's already

605
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:35,740
turning into a tree?

606
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,617
I thought we'd

607
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:37,617
have more time.

608
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,327
Actually, you've been

609
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,327
asleep for three days.

610
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,663
Three days?

611
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:44,665
Mm hm.

612
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,250
You were asleep so long, we were

613
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,250
afraid you wouldn't be able

614
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,835
to move when you woke up,

615
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,046
but thankfully you just

616
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:50,046
wore yourself down.

617
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,130
Oh, dear.

618
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,840
We have to get

619
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,840
back to the hive.

620
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,258
I've wasted so much time.

621
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,552
Now hang on there,

622
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,552
Fluttershy,

623
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,638
those Flash Bee

624
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,638
critters are tricky.

625
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,973
Cattail's right.

626
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,433
I can't even use magic

627
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,433
to calm them down.

628
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,602
We'll have to find another

629
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,602
way to get the honey.

630
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,313
We've tried everything

631
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,313
from disguises

632
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,983
to things I won't

633
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,983
even speak of.

[gasp] That's it!

640
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,459
I know how she did it!

641
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,044
I know how Meadowbrook

642
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,044
got the honey!

643
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:38,136
This is how Meadowbrook got

644
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:38,136
the honey from the Flash Bees.

645
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,220
She threw a mask at 'em?

646
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,222
I wouldn't recommend that.

647
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,726
No. The male bees aren't

648
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:45,726
aggressive around the queen bee

649
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,938
and this mask has the same

650
00:19:45,768 --> 00:19:48,938
stripes that she does!

651
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,439
Fluttershy, that's brilliant!

00:19:52,358 --> 00:19:53,317

00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,902
Whoa!

00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,570
There's no time to waste!

It's working!

I think she's cured

665
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,740
now, Fluttershy.

Thank you Fluttershy,

00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:54,003
for all you endured.

674
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:58,298

you should feel,

That's true.

684

I certainly learned that if you

685
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,813
don't take care of yourself,

686
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,649
you won't be able to take

care of anypony else.

690
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:24,324
maybe I would have thought to
